aVit\u2019s because israel cherishes life, that israel cherishes peace and seeks peace.

aVi say to him and i say to you:
p4
aVyeah, right\u2026
p5
aVthat\u2019s like saying a nuclear-armed al-qaeda would usher in an era of universal peace.
p6
aVthe simplest example is gunpowder and a fuse. that is, you light the fuse and set off the gunpowder.
p7
aVeach day, that point is getting closer. that\u2019s why i speak today with such a sense of urgency. and that\u2019s why everyone should have a sense of urgency.
p8
aVwhat i have said today will help ensure that this common goal is achieved.
p9
aVisrael is in discussions with the united states over this issue, and i am confident that we can chart a path forward together.
p10
aVlet us commit ourselves today to defend these values so that we can defend our freedom and protect our common civilization.
p11
aVi ended that first speech by saying: gentlemen, check your fanaticism at the door.
p12
aVthis conflict rages because for the palestinians, the real settlements they\u2019re after are haifa, jaffa and tel aviv.
p13
aVhow can any of us expect young palestinians to support peace when their leaders poison their minds against peace?
p14
aVwe can do this.
p15
aVafter 70 years, the world is embracing israel, and israel is embracing the world.

Vyesterday was yom kippur, the holiest day of the jewish year.
p18
aVbut at the end of yom kippur, we celebrate.
p19
aVunfortunately, that is not the case in many other countries. for today, a great battle is being waged between the modern and the medieval.
p20
aVthese forces clash around the globe, but nowhere more starkly than in the middle east.
p21
aVwe\u2019ve seen that happen before.
p22
aVwe\u2019ve seen that happen before too.
p23
aVi\u2019ve been speaking about the need to prevent iran from developing nuclear weapons for over 15 years.
p24
aVin the case of iran\u2019s plans to build a nuclear weapon, the gunpowder is enriched uranium. the fuse is a nuclear detonator.
p25
aVfor iran, amassing enough enriched uranium is far more difficult than producing the nuclear fuse.
p26
aVso, how much enriched uranium do you need for a bomb? and how close is iran to getting it?
p27
aVthis is a bomb; this is a fuse.
p28
aVthe first stage: they have to enrich enough of low enriched uranium.
p29
aVthe second stage: they have to enrich enough medium enriched uranium.
p30
aVand the third stage and final stage: they have to enrich enough high enriched uranium for the first bomb.
p31
aVfrom there, it\u2019s only a few months, possibly a few weeks before they get enough enriched uranium for the first bomb.
p32
aVbut they are not foolproof.
p33
aVthe clash between modernity and medievalism need not be a clash between progress and tradition.
p34
aVwe champion these principles not despite of our traditions but because of them.
p35
aVladies and gentlemen, a year later, north korea exploded its first nuclear weapons device.
p36
aVthat\u2019s the central lesson of the 20th century. and we cannot forget it. the world may have forgotten this lesson. the jewish people have not.
p37
aVthe re-birth of israel is a testament to the indomitable spirit of my people.
p38
aVenough!
p39
aVthe sooner the un\u2019s obsession with israel ends, the better. the better for israel, the better for your countries, the better for the un itself.
p40
aVthe sooner the un\u2019s obsession with israel ends, the better. the better for israel, the better for your countries, the better for the un itself.

aVwe will never be uprooted again.
p46
ag2
aVladies and gentlemen,
p47
aVbasically, any bomb consists of explosive material and a mechanism to ignite it.
p48
aVin contrast, iran could produce the nuclear detonator \u2013 the fuse \u2013 in a lot less time, maybe under a year, maybe only a few months.
p49
aVladies and gentlemen,

aVpresident abbas just spoke here.
p74
aVthe traditions of the jewish people go back thousands of years. they are the source of our collective values and the foundation of our national strength.
p75
aVthese are the timeless values of my people and these are the jewish people\u2019s greatest gift to mankind.
p76
aVand we re-established our sovereign state in our ancestral homeland, the land of israel.

aVstand with israel because israel is not just defending itself. more than ever, israel is defending you.
p90
aVwhat i\u2019m about to say is going to shock you: israel has a bright future at the un.
p91
aVthe un, begun as a moral force, has become a moral farce.
p92
aVthe issue of settlements is a real one and it can and must be resolved in final status negotiations.

Vthe forces of medievalism seek a world in which women and minorities are subjugated, in which knowledge is suppressed, in which not life but death is glorified.
p97
aVi am sure of one thing. ultimately they will fail. ultimately, light will penetrate the darkness.
p98
aVto understand what the world would be like with a nuclear-armed iran, just imagine the world with a nuclear-armed al-qaeda.
p99
aVjust look at what the iranian regime has done up till now, without nuclear weapons.
p100
aVthere are those who believe that a nuclear-armed iran can be deterred like the soviet union.
p101
aVthat\u2019s a very dangerous assumption.
p102
aVthat\u2019s not just what they believe. that\u2019s what is actually guiding their policies and their actions.
p103
aVand that\u2019s coming from one of the so-called moderates of iran.

aVfor nearly a decade, the international community has tried to stop the iranian nuclear program with diplomacy.
p105
aVthat hasn\u2019t worked.
p106
aViran uses diplomatic negotiations as a means to buy time to advance its nuclear program.
p107
aVit\u2019s had an effect on the economy, but we must face the truth. sanctions have not stopped iran\u2019s nuclear program either.
p108
aVred lines don\u2019t lead to war; red lines prevent war.
p109
aVin fact, it\u2019s the failure to place red lines that has often invited aggression.
p110
aVclear red lines have also worked with iran.
p111
ag49
aVso if these are the facts, and they are, where should the red line be drawn?
p112
aVthe red line should be drawn right here\u2026
p113
ag8
aVdo we want to risk the security of the world on the assumption that we would find in time a small workshop in a country half the size of europe?
p114
aVi believe that faced with a clear red line, iran will back down.
p115
aVthis will give more time for sanctions and diplomacy to convince iran to dismantle its nuclear weapons program altogether.
p116
aV\u201cwe are glad that we are in the forefront of executing the supreme leader\u2019s order to destroy israel.\u201d
p117
aVit\u2019s not easy to oppose something that is embraced by the greatest powers in the world. believe me, it would be far easier to remain silent.
p118
aVnot being passive means speaking up about those dangers. we have. we are. we will.
p119
aVnot being passive also means defending ourselves against those dangers. we have. we are. and we will.

p122
aVnow, for some, this story shows that both sides have their extremists and both sides are equally responsible for this seemingly endless conflict.

aVmilitant jihadists behave very differently from secular marxists. there were no soviet suicide bombers. yet iran produces hordes of them.
p128
aVdeterrence worked with the soviets, because every time the soviets faced a choice between their ideology and their survival, they chose their survival.
p129
aVbut deterrence may not work with the iranians once they get nuclear weapons.
p130
aVshockingly, some people have begun to peddle the absurd notion that a nuclear-armed iran would actually stabilize the middle east.
