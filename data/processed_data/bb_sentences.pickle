VWhat do you think about the deal with Iran?
p1
aVHas the Middle East entered a phase of accelerated speed and change?
p2
aVBefore the Palestinians went to the UN, Israel threatened harsh measures in response and now you announced new settlement building between Jerusalem and Maaleh Adumin. If further settlement construction is Israel\u2019s default option, it makes it very difficult to believe that you\u2019re really interested in a peace agreement.
p3
aVWith the swift and careful action in Gaza, it seemed that Israel had gained international credit and also the fact that it stopped before a ground invasion. Now it seems that you\u2019re losing the credit that you gained in Europe with the announced settlement building. The French and British have even threatened to recall their ambassadors.
p4
aVBut the very place where you announced settlement building is a place where construction will make it very difficult in the future to come to a peace agreement with the Palestinians. It\u2019s vital for a future Palestinian state.
p5
aVWere you surprised by the reaction of France and UK and Sweden?
p6
aVSo what you\u2019re basically saying is that the countries that voted for the associate membership status of the Palestinian state violated the Oslo Agreement?
p7
aVYour government also decided to hold back tax transfers to the PA and use them for outstanding electricity bills. Many of your security experts have frequently warned that stripping the PA of money could destabilize the situation in the West Bank and endanger the security cooperation Israel.
p8
aVSince the start of the Arab revolts Israel seems to be increasingly beleaguered and on the defense. Was the Gaza war an attempt to play on the offense again?
p9
aVIn Europe many people consider you to be a hardliner, so it took some people by surprise that you didn\u2019t order a ground attack in Gaza. Also many Israelis didn\u2019t like that because they wanted to finish off the extremists for good this time. What were the reasons you decided to hold back even after the Cabinet had agreed to the biggest mobilization since the Lebanon War?
p10
aVAn Israeli TV channel suggested that there were other factors also. They reported that the Egyptians had threatened to cancel the peace agreement if Israel invaded Gaza. Is that correct?
p11
aVIf we look at all the threats that Israel faces, why would anyone in the world want your job? It seems to be the toughest job in the world.
p12
aVYou and your brother have both been in the military. Your older brother died in action. You were wounded. Do you think this makes you hard or determined in a way that European politicians in this generation that you\u2019re dealing with, who were born after the Second World War, just can\u2019t understand? That you can\u2019t find a common language in some cases because it\u2019s just such a different experience?
p13
aVWhen the Arab revolutions began, Israel warned of the possible consequences. It seems now that the Islamist movements are the victors of this development, and it seems also that Israel\u2019s hands are increasingly tied, also politically, in the region. How do you navigate in this kind of environment?
p14
aVCan you feel that your maneuvering space is getting smaller?
p15
aVIsrael\u2019s well-being is not only threatened by external developments; it seems that the productive part of society in Israel itself is getting always smaller. You could call it a middle-class squeeze because they are the ones who have to pay the taxes and who go to the army. According to the OECD, the Israeli school system is also falling behind. What would a new Netanyahu government do to change that?
p16
aVI meet a lot of young Israelis moving to Berlin and of course if you go to New York, you have a lot of bright, young Israelis living there, working there, founding companies there. Do you fear that the stress you have here, this political situation pushes some of the brightest people out of the country to some places where they feel safer?
p17
aVAnd you need everyone committed to the state, so do you see a chance to get the ultra-orthodox to serve in the army?
p18
aVBut you can\u2019t force them.
p19
aVHow does that work?
p20
aVIs that what you plan on doing, implement further cuts in child allowances?
p21
aVYour Likud party significantly moved to the right in the vote for the party list. How does it feel for a man with your political and ideological history to find himself at the left fringes of your own party?
p22
aVLike you did?
p23
aVIn the latest Gaza offensive, the German government and Angela Merkel personally were very vocal in defending Israel\u2019s right to defend itself against rockets from Gaza, but on the other hand some Israelis have been disappointed that Germany didn\u2019t vote against the Palestinian move at the UN. Are you coming with mixed feelings to Berlin?
p24
aVYou lost your father this year. He was a renowned historian. Could you describe what his legacy means for you or what the most important political lesson is that he taught you?
p25
aVTwo days ago, at the rally at Rabin Square, David Grossman, who lost his son Uri in the second Lebanon War, stood and spoke in a speech directed at you, during which he said: \u201cWhen is the last time the Prime Minister expressed or made a move which is in his power to open a new horizon for Israelis, a better future?  When has he initiated a social or cultural or meritorious step rather than simply respond \u2013 respond recklessly to moves forced on him by others?\u201d  Is there truth in this?
p26
aVCurrently the Realignment is frozen and there is not alternative.  The coalition is one of the broadest that have been, but to where does it lead?  Where are we going?
p27
aVIt is not the goal, it is the tool.
p28
aVIn that same speech, Grossman said: \u201cIf an Arab president or leader approaches you and wants to meet or make peace, you do not have the moral right not to invite him immediately for a meeting.
p29
aVThere does not need to be anything from Syria or Lebanon?
p30
aVYou want to meet with him? Are you calling on him to meet?
p31
aVWithout preconditions, are you prepared to meet with Asad as well?
p32
aVI am not always certain that you have time to make these decisions, because since you became Prime Minister \u2013 the State Comptroller has begun investigating you on a scale which is unprecedented.  Is all this smoke with no fire?
p33
aVIf there is an organized campaign, there must be an organizer.
p34
aVIs this a political conspiracy?
p35
aVThe announcement stated that generally, the State Comptroller is exceeding his authority and ruining the institution of the State Comptroller.  I understand that you agree with this.
p36
aVDo you sometimes get angry at yourself?  Do you ask yourself, \u201cperhaps I was not sensitive enough, perhaps I was not cautious enough as a public figure?\u201d \u2013 political insensitivity.
p37
aVYou say malicious and organized.  Do you mean that it is not just Lindenstrauss alone, but something broader?
p38
aVIt was written in the papers that in the polls, the public views you as the most corrupt leader.
p39
aVThis morning, thousands of Haredim again violently protested the Gay Pride Parade and the Attorney General decided that the Parade will take place in Jerusalem.  What do you think about that?
p40
aVTo conclude, a question with a one word answer: did we, in your opinion, win or lose the war?
p41
aVGood afternoon.  Well, can I just say first of all what a pleasure it is for me to be here, to be invited to conduct what I hope will be an important interview with the Prime Minister at Sky News.  We are well aware that we even have paying customers in Israel, so we very much try to please that audience and those viewers.
p42
aVNow, usually when I talk to august personages such as prime ministers, we are very hurried for time, but on this occasion, we have time for a fairly decent conversation.  So, I thought we would move through a number of issues that concern this conference, of course, in a moment, the perhaps perennial problems of the Middle East, but also maybe begin with some topical questions.
p43
aVIf you do not mind, before I start with American politics, which naturally is very important \u2013 it is almost even more important than our internal politics because it helps sometimes \u2013 I want first to take this opportunity to express my deep regret over the events which took place yesterday morning in Beit Hanoun, with the unfortunate shooting of Israeli artillery on innocent Palestinians in Beit Hanoun, which resulted in the killing of 18 civilians, most of them are members of one family.  This is certainly not the policy of Israel, this is not the objective of the Government of Israel, and this is tragic and we are very sad about it, and we deeply regret it.
p44
aVI was going to move on to that.  But to get down to a very important matter, can I put it to you that whatever the intentions of the two sides may be, that this question of proportionality keeps on being raised in this issue that in practice Palestinian civilians or earlier in the year, Lebanese civilians appeared to be hit disproportionately in the view of many people, and that is something which is damaging Israel's standing in the world.
p45
aVMany people measure it in terms of the number of people killed, the number of military personnel killed versus the number of civilians killed, and that is why Israel is so often criticized internationally.
p46
aVBut in that case, a lot of women and a lot of children were killed.
p47
aVSo, unfortunately, it does happen here.  We try to avoid it. I never use it as an excuse.  This is not an excuse.  What I am trying to do is to explain to you that unfortunately, against our better intentions, it occasionally does happen.  And we regret each and every case.
p48
aVMilitary operations will continue as long as there will be Qassam shooting on innocent people.  What kind of military operations, depends.  But we are not going to stop it.
p49
aVNo, we will not shoot with artillery. We will take precautions in order to avoid unnecessary mistakes.  That is for sure.  But I want to be very sincere with you.  We try to avoid the unnecessary involvement of innocent civilians which are not part of terror.  But I cannot promise that it will not happen.
p50
aVYou could say you simply will not attack targets of that sort and in that way.
p51
aVBut what is more is that the Qassam shooting does not help either.  And they have to remember it.
p52
aVHow much harder can they be?  Let us be realistic.  You look at them and you really wonder.  Here is Gaza, take Gaza.
p53
aVThe problem is, you are not disengaged, though, are you, militarily?
p54
aVBut one cannot ignore the fact that in spite of this, in spite of the fact that they cannot claim that we occupy one centimeter of Gaza, they did not stop shooting Qassam rockets at us from day one.  What else do you need to do?  What else do you need to do in order to convince them that it is time for them to reconcile, to change their priorities, to get to the table and sit down and talk seriously, rather than shoot and shoot and shoot and call for more terror, and cause so many victims on the Palestinian side, and destroy every fabric of life at a time when they could flourish.  I mean, they can look at us \u2013 it is not from a big distance \u2013 and they can see how the economy of Israel is flourishing.  And can you imagine what they could have had they been more cooperative?
p55
aVMay I ask you something?  Since you mentioned that you came with Tony Blair, did you come with your wife?
p56
aVWith your wife?
p57
aVWould you tell us, the audience\u2026 I mean, you do not mind that I am asking you questions, rather than answering.
p58
aVTell us a story about your wedding.
p59
aVYes.  At 10 Downing.
p60
aVYes, what happened when you married.  Was there any demonstration outside.
p61
aVAlright.
p62
aVYou see, these British guys, they only know how to ask the questions.  They do not know how to answer.
p63
aVWhy?  Because of what?
p64
aVAnd also? \u2026Tony Blair is someone I admire greatly.  I like him very much, I have to say.  He is my kind of guy.  He is a good guy, he is a really good guy.  And he suffered a lot because of what was perceived in Great Britain as his great support for Israel.  Partly, it was expressed while he was found to be in the wedding of Adam Bolton and his wife, who used to work for Tony Blair.  That is the story.
p65
aVI did not want to embarrass you.
p66
aVLook, first of all, I can understand, simply and easily, why so many people were uncomfortable with this event.  I am very uncomfortable with this event.  I am very distressed.  This is the worst that could happen to them and to us.  And the reasons are less important, but not entirely unimportant.
p67
aVWhy has that not happened yet then?
p68
aVWhat can you offer him?
p69
aVI am ready.  I say it often.  I could not be more open.  I could not be more sincere about it.  I will not release one to the Hamas, because they will not be paid off for extremity, but to Abu Mazen, many \u2013 I am ready to release many.  I was, I am and I will.
p70
aVYou heard about the Realignment Plan, right?  That I spelled out before the elections.  For the first time, at least in the recent history of Israel, a candidate for Prime Minister who was quite safe at that time, comes here and says, 'I'm ready to pull out of almost 90% of the territories.'
p71
aVListen, we are not going to commit suicide here.  Let it be clear.  We are going to fight, and we have proved it.  We proved it in Lebanon.  We have no sense of humor when someone attacks us.  We take it very seriously.  But we are ready to compromise in a serious manner if they are up for some serious business.  But they are controlled by the terrorists.  And Khaled Mashal is the prophet of the Palestinians, not Abu Mazen.  That is why everything is stuck.
p72
aVYou know, there was one time that I did not [unclear].  You know, because you were in my garden, in my home, when he was having dinner with me, and then we went to the press to be interviewed, to answer to some questions.  So, this was the first time that I thought that maybe Israeli journalists are not the worst in the world.
p73
aVI am ready to take part in it, not in any patronizing manner that I am going to control the Palestinians, but if there will be an international effort, led by Great Britain, to help strengthen the civil administration of the Palestinians, in order to make it reasonable and effective and helpful, I am ready to be part of it, and join in with him.
p74
aVWhat about if Tony Blair goes back to Syria, talks to President Assad again. Nigel Sheinwald was there.  Would that be a good idea or a bad idea?
p75
aV[Unclear] said that unless Syria is engaged, there can be no settlement.
p76
aVI am not against having an agreement with Syria.  It is just that, you know, Bashar Assad cannot eat the cake and have it at the same time.  That is something that we cannot accept.  He cannot sponsor the Hizbullah, sponsor Kahled Mashal, finance and actively support the terrorist actions throughout the Middle East, cannot be the most devoted partner of Iran, which calls for the liquidation of the State of Israel, and at the same time, get the bonus of the appearance of moderation by having some contacts with Israel.  This does not go together.
p77
aVHe has got to change, a little bit.  He has got to show some signs of change, some kind of seriousness.
p78
aVIn exchange?  You would like me to already exchange with you what he may expect to exchange with me if he will change?
p79
aVLook, Israel has, I think, proved in the past that we are ready for serious business with Syria if they are ready.  Serious business.
p80
aVOkay, let us move on to President Bush.
p81
aVIs he a lame duck?  Is it a waste of time really going to see him at all?
p82
aVthank G-d Bush is the President of the United States of America.  That I can say as Prime Minister of Israel.
p83
aVYou know Bush, do you?
p84
aVI can say that from our perspective any pullout, whenever it will take place, will have to be very carefully planned, in order not to upset the very delicate balance of the moderate countries in the Middle East and that includes some Arab countries and emirates and so on.  And I think that this is a major consideration.  I think that America, regardless of whether it is a Republican America or a Democratic America, will be very cautious before it makes a move that can jeopardize the balance, the delicate balance in this part of the world which is so extremely important for the stability in much larger parts of the world.
p85
aVFirst of all, I think that we entertain the support of so many legislatures, both in the House and in the Senate, that we don't count their religion, so it's interesting; it certainly is a reflection of the vitality of the Jewish community in America, but as far as Israel is concerned, thank G-d we have many supporters in America, also some Jews.
p86
aVI don't think that you noticed that we have with us here the Governor of the Israeli Bank, Professor Fischer, sitting next the to the Minister of Finance, Mr. Hirchson, and the chairman of the Manufacturers Association, Mr. Brosh.
p87
aVI remember all my life, ever since I was aware of what economics is all about, and what business is all about, we always said, export, export, export.  We have here a guy who soon will be recognized, Stef Wertheimer.  I know him, I don't know how many years, 25 years. He once, you could look at him, you wouldn't believe, but he was a Member of Parliament.  He doesn't want to remember those four years, but he was.  The one sentence that I remember from him, whenever one would mention his name to me, Stef Wertheimer, is exports.  When I was first appointed Minister of Industry and Trad \u2013 now there is Mr. Yishai sitting here, he is the Minister of Industry and Trade, I was four years ago \u2013 the first thing he came to me and say, squeeze for exports, don't forget exports, exports is the name of the game.  We have a positive surplus, it's unbelievable. It's unbelievable.
p88
aVWe have to continue to invest in the periphery, and we have to make a dramatic change in the priorities within the State of Israel to seriously cope with the social difficulties, particularly of the underprivileged in our country.  The gap is too wide; it has to be narrowed down.  It's not enough that we, through the consistent growth of our economy, we are raising the income per capita; we have to make genuine efforts so that this income will be divided in a more evenly manner than it was up until now.
p89
aVAbsolutely.
p90
aVNow I have to ask you, why is Mr. Lieberman then part of your Government?
p91
aVThat we would have done with or without Lieberman and we will do it with Lieberman.  And on top of it, since you asked about Lieberman, we need a stable government in Israel.  We are sick and tired of going to elections every two years.  We are going to change the government system in Israel and this is going to be one of my top priorities, and Lieberman is going to be very helpful in making these reforms possible and that's why I'm very happy that he's in the Government.
p92
aVYou had a lot of continuity and stability in the actual policies.  You had too many ministers, but now we have the best, so I'm not worried.
p93
aVWell, he was on the panel when this\u2026
p94
aVHe didn't complain about it.
p95
aVI think that we have to increase the allocations through the Chief Scientist for research and development and that includes also bio-technology.  I think that we, I myself for instance, last year allocated through the Chief Scientist to the Ben Gurion University major funds in order to establish the National Center for Bio-Technology which will be part of the academics of Ben Guiron University, and the industrial park which is going to be developed, Industrial Park for Bio-Technologies next door.  So we are making efforts.
p96
aVThere have been major problems with the brain chain, have been problems with higher education.  You set up a panel to deal with higher education.
p97
aVWhat have you got to do with Israel's universities?
p98
aVYes.
p99
aVYou set up a panel which suggests you have got of work to do.
p100
aVYou sound like a man who is sort of settling in for a long stint in office, yet you look at the opinion polls, a very negative one about trust relating to you yesterday. Do you think you're going to be able to survive?
p101
aVSo listen, Israeli politics is very volatile and very dynamic and one thing which I have learned over the years is that you have to be very careful and build up your strategy for a long time, and that is what I am doing.  And my plans is that we will go through the full term of four years and 8 months, so we have almost four years still ahead of us.  And then I promise you, Adam, that I will arrange for the Prime Minister's Conference to invite you again to interview me about the plans for the next four years.
p102
aVOn the day that we decided to respond to the provocation of Hizbullah, we outlined the three objectives for the war.  One was to implement fully Resolution 1559 of the United Nations which was adopted 2-3 years before but was never implemented; to deploy the Lebanese army in the south of Lebanon; and to remove the danger or the threat of the Hizbullah.  The 1701 which includes 1559 of the United Nations was adopted, implemented, Lebanese army is deployed in Lebanon and there is an international army on top of it.
p103
aVIn all of those occasions when they attacked Israel and shot rockets on our northern part of Israel, there was no deterrence. They kept fighting, they kept trying.  Now ask them if they will try again.  I will only remind you of what Nasrallah said, 'Had I known only 1% of what would happen, I would have never started.'  Now he knows.  Therefore my judgment is that as a result of this war, of this 'disproportionate reaction' of Israel, they will not start another such war against the State of Israel.  And therefore I think that the outcome of this war is very good.
p104
aVIran is a different. I don't think that the danger of Iran started on the twelfth of July.   Only those who were asleep for many years didn't notice that Iran was becoming an imminent danger, not just to Israel, to the whole Western civilization.  It is a danger.  Now we are a lot more conscious about this danger than we were before the twelfth of July because of the war in Lebanon.  Therefore in this respect also we are more conscious, we are more aware, we are going to address ourselves to this in a much more serous manner, and there is a greater chance that we will be ready to prevent it better than we could had the fighting in Lebanon not take place altogether.
p105
aVlook at your team, Newcastle United, is losing all the time.  So he says, I know you are a fan of Manchester United, so I tell you I don't mind that Roman Abramowitz spends so much money on Chelsey; he spends money but not on soccer in Israel, on something different.
p106
aVPardon?   No, my club, yes, I don't think that he's an oligarch. Not that he is one of my revered personalities, but he came to Israel at the age of 20, so he didn't make his money in what is considered to be the oligarch pattern of making money.  In this respect he is not an oligarch. But all the big soccer teams are owned by rich people, right?  And I'll tell you something, whether I like him or not, I am a great fan of Beitar Jerusalem, and I hope that they will win the championship in Israel and will go to play in Europe and will do well in Europe.
p107
aVWe are going to play against Great Britain.  First we are going to play against Croatia soon.  And I very much, I hope that Robinson will be the goal keeper in the game between Israel and Great Britain.
p108
aVMr. Prime Minister, the president described the meetings today as frank and productive. Were told you might be able to add the words "blunt" and "testy." Is that fair?
p109
aVIf that condition has been removed, I dont know it. It has been a precondition as far as the Palestinians were concerned to come to the table. You have preconditions. They have preconditions. One of them is that settlements stop.
p110
aVBut Mr. Prime Minister, are you saying unequivocally, you will not offer any kind of a freeze - limited, full, any kind of a freeze - on settlements as a precondition to talks?
p111
aVWould you take some kind of a freeze for eight months or 12 months, since I understand that was discussed today?
p112
aVA former Israeli prime minister, the great Abba Eban, used to say about the Palestinians, they never miss an opportunity to miss an opportunity. If you take this position on settlements, arent you missing an opportunity?
p113
aVBut I come back to the point. You have preconditions, they have preconditions. By not making some move in the direction of their preconditions, arent you missing an opportunity or dont you run the risk of missing an opportunity?
p114
aVLet me put that picture right back up, OK.  The handshake between you and Mr. Abbas \u2013 does it mean anything? Does it show any sign of progress or is that a long overdue photo-op?
p115
aVBut where do we stand? The President, you\u2019re saying the right things.  President Obama is saying the right things.  He says it\u2019s the time to act.  There\u2019s a window of opportunity.  He\u2019s going to send Hillary Clinton and George Mitchell back to the Middle East and try and build on this progress, but the fact of the matter is, George Mitchell just returned from the Middle East and accomplished almost nothing.  He didn\u2019t get the Palestinians to agree to negotiate without pre-conditions, he didn\u2019t get you to agree to dropping your insistence there could be no freeze of settlements.  So where do we stand?  What progress can we build on?
p116
aVYou say that you\u2019re willing to talk to the Palestinians without pre-conditions, but by refusing to freeze settlements on the West Bank, they say that that\u2019s a hollow promise \u2013 that you know you have basically stopped peace talks before they can begin.   How do you respond to that?
p117
aVHow big a gesture?
p118
aVLet me ask you a blunt question.  Does President Obama possess right now the clout and the power to move this process forward?  Some have suggested that the weak economy in this country has weakened the President to the point where he has no clout.
p119
aVReal quickly, I want to end and I\u2019m sorry to cut short the time.  But on Iran \u2013 you said that Iran is weaker than people think.  You are convinced that they are attempting to build nuclear weapons, and you\u2019ve said tougher sanctions are a way to prevent that.  China and Russia have never been on board with those tougher sanctions.  The President tried yesterday to talk to the Chinese about that \u2013 it\u2019s unclear if he made any progress.  Absent China and Russia joining that move for tougher sanctions \u2013 if they continue to move down the road they\u2019re on and develop nuclear weapons, in your opinion, at what point do you go it alone?  At what point do you strike?
p120
aVMr. Prime Minister, it\u2019s good to have you in the studio. Good luck this week at the UN.
p121
aVi can guarantee you this, the days when the jewish people remained passive in the face of genocidal enemies, those days are over!
p122
aVthe truth is that if israel were to put down its arms there would be no more israel.
p123
aVif the arabs were to put down their arms there would be no more war.
p124
aVif iran's work on advanced centrifuges, faster and faster centrifuges, is not stopped, that break-out time could still be shorter, a lot shorter.
p125
aVtrue, certain restrictions would be imposed on iran's nuclear program and iran's adherence to those restrictions would be supervised by international inspectors.
p126
aVbut here's the problem.
p127
aVyou see, inspectors document violations; they don't stop them.
p128
aVinspectors knew when north korea broke to the bomb, but that didn't stop anything.
p129
aVnorth korea turned off the cameras, kicked out the inspectors.
p130
aVwithin a few years, it got the bomb.
p131
aVnow, we're warned that within five years north korea could have an arsenal of 100 nuclear bombs.
p132
aVlike north korea, iran, too, has defied international inspectors.
p133
aVit's done that on at least three separate occasions; 2005, 2006, 2010. like north korea, iran broke the locks, shut off the cameras.
p134
aVwe are benefiting from one thing, and that is the attack on the twin towers and pentagon, and the american struggle in iraq.
p135
aVthe events swung american public opinion in our favor.
p136
aVi think the israeli people understand now what i always say: that there cannot be a situation, under any agreement, in which we relinquish security control of the territory west of the river jordan... we will defend ourselves on every front, defensively and offensively.
p137
aVisrael has no better friend than america.
p138
aVand america has no better friend than israel.
p139
aVwe stand together to defend democracy.
p140
aVwe stand together to advance peace.
p141
aVwe stand together to fight terrorism.
p142
aVcongratulations america.
p143
aVcongratulations, mister president.
p144
aVyou got bin laden.
p145
aVi am certain that i speak on behalf of my entire nation when i say: today we are all \u2014 in grief, as in defiance.
p146
aVthe difference is that isis is armed with butcher knives, captured weapons and youtube, whereas iran could soon be armed with intercontinental ballistic missiles and nuclear bombs.
p147
aVwe must always remember.
p148
aVi'll say it one more time; the greatest dangers facing our world is the marriage of militant islam with nuclear weapons.
p149
aVto defeat isis and let iran get nuclear weapons would be to win the battle, but lose the war.
p150
aVwe can't let that happen.
p151
aVisrael without jerusalem is like a body without a heart.
p152
aVour heart will never be divided again \u000a\u000ai, the prime minister of israel, care more about palestinians than their own leaders do.
p153
aVisrael cares more about palestinians than their own leaders do.
p154
aVwe will bring a comprehensive plan to the government to assist you in every way.
p155
aVthere is no room for racism and discrimination in our society, none... we will turn racism into something contemptible and despicable.
p156
aVisrael has extended its hand in peace from the moment it was established... in israel our hope for peace never wanes.
p157
aVour scientists, doctors, and innovators apply their genius to improve the world of tomorrow.
p158
aVour artists, our writers, enrich the heritage of humanity.
p159
aVnow, i know that this is not exactly the image of israel that is often portrayed... \u000a\u000ayou don't need to do nation building in israel, we're already built.
p160
aVyou don't need to export democracy to israel, we've already got it.
p161
aVyou don't need to send american troops to israel, we defend ourselves... israel is not what is wrong about the middle east, israel is what is about the middle east... the tyranny in tehran brutalizes its own people.
p162
aVit supports attacks against american troops in afghanistan and iraq.
p163
aVit subjugates lebanon and gaza.
p164
aVit sponsors terror worldwide... a nuclear-armed iran would ignite a nuclear arms race in the middle east.
p165
aVit would give terrorists a nuclear umbrella.
p166
aVit would make the nightmare of nuclear terrorism a clear and present danger throughout the world.
p167
aVi want you to understand what this means.
p168
aVthey could put the bomb anywhere.
p169
aVthey could put it on a missile.
p170
aVit could be on a container ship in a port, or in a suitcase on a subway... now the threat to my country cannot be overstated.
p171
aVthose who dismiss it are sticking their heads in the sand.
p172
aVless than seven decades after six million jews were murdered, iran's leaders deny the holocaust of the jewish people, while calling for the annihilation of the jewish state.
p173
aVleaders who spew such venom, should be banned from every respectable forum on the planet.
p174
aVbut there is something that makes the outrage even greater: the lack of outrage.
p175
aVin much of the international community, the calls for our destruction are met with utter silence.
p176
aVit is even worse because there are many who rush to condemn israel for defending itself against iran's terror proxies... when we say never again, we never again!
p177
aVisrael always reserves the right to defend itself... in judea and samaria, the jewish people are not foreign occupiers.
p178
aVwe are not the british in india.
p179
aVwe are not the belgians in the congo.
p180
aVthis is the land of our forefathers, the land of israel, to which abraham brought the idea of one god, where david set out to confront goliath, and where isaiah saw a vision of eternal peace... no distortion of history can deny the four thousand year old bond, between the jewish people and the jewish land... peace cannot be imposed.
p181
aVit must be negotiated.
p182
aVbut it can only be negotiated with partners committed to peace.
p183
aVas dangerous as a nuclear-armed north korea is, it pales in comparison to the danger of a nuclear-armed iran.
p184
aVa nuclear-armed iran in the middle east wouldn't be another north korea.
p185
aVit would be another 50 north koreas.
p186
aVi came here tonight to talk about the agreement and security that are broad consensus within israeli society.
p187
aVthis is what guides our policy.
p188
aVthis policy must take into account the international situation.
p189
aVwe have to recognize international agreements but also principles important to the state of israel.
p190
aVi spoke tonight about the first principle - recognition.
p191
aVpalestinians must truly recognize israel as the state of the jewish people.
p192
aVthe second principle is demilitarization.
p193
aVany area in palestinian hands has to be demilitarization, with solid security measures.
p194
aVwithout this condition, there is a real fear that there will be an armed palestinian state which will become a terrorist base against israel, as happened in gaza.
p195
aVwe do not want missiles on petah tikva, or grads on the ben-gurion international airport.
p196
aVwe want peace.
p197
aVi know what america is.
p198
aVamerica is a thing you can move very easily, move it in the right direction.
p199
aVthey won't get in our way.
p200
aV\u2026 they asked me before the election if i'd honor [the oslo accords] \u2026 i said i would, but \u2026 i'm going to interpret the accords in such a way that would allow me to put an end to this galloping forward to the '67 borders.
p201
aVhow did we do it?
p202
aVnobody said what defined military zones were.
p203
aVdefined military zones are security zones; as far as i'm concerned, the entire jordan valley is a defined military zone.
p204
aVgo argue.
p205
aVthey say that a military confrontation with iran would undermine the efforts already underway, that it would be ineffective, and that it would provoke even more vindictive action by iran.
p206
aVi've heard these arguments before.
p207
aVin fact, i've read them before.
p208
aVin my desk, i have copies of an exchange of letters between the world jewish congress and the us war department.
p209
aVthe year was 1944. the world jewish congress implored the american government to bomb auschwitz.
p210
aVthe reply came five days later.
p211
aVi want to read it to you: \u201csuch an operation could be executed only by diverting considerable air support essential to the success of our forces elsewhere... and in any case would be of such doubtful efficacy that it would not warrant the use of our resources\u201d... and here's the most remarkable sentence of all.
p212
aVand i quote: \u201csuch an effort might provoke even more vindictive action by the germans.\u201d think about that \u2013 \u201ceven more vindictive action\u201d \u2014 than the holocaust.
p213
aVthe root cause of terrorism lies not in grievances but in a disposition toward unbridled violence.
p214
aVthis can be traced to a world view which asserts that certain ideological and religious goals justify, indeed demand, the shedding of all moral inhibitions.
p215
aVthe people of iran are very talented people.
p216
aVthey're heirs to one of the world's great civilizations.
p217
aVbut in 1979, they were hijacked by religious zealots; religious zealots who imposed on them immediately a dark and brutal dictatorship.
p218
aVthat year, the zealots drafted a constitution, a new one for iran.
p219
aVit directed the revolutionary guards not only to protect iran's borders, but also to fulfill the ideological mission of jihad.
p220
aVthe regime's founder, ayatollah khomeini, exhorted his followers to export the revolution throughout the world.
p221
aVi'm standing here in washington, d.c. and the difference is so stark.
p222
aVamerica's founding document promises life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.
p223
aViran's founding document pledges death, tyranny, and the pursuit of jihad.
p224
aVand as states are collapsing across the middle east, iran is charging into the void to do just that.
p225
aVto say that doesn't practice terrorism is like saying never played shortstop for the .
p226
aVbut then the question came up of just who would define what defined military sites were.
p227
aVi received a letter \u2013 to my and to arafat, at the same time \u2013 which said that israel, and only israel, would be the one to define what those are, the location of those military sites and their size.
p228
aVnow, they did not want to give me that letter, so i did not give the hebron agreement.
p229
aVi stopped the government meeting, i said: \u201ci\u2019m not signing.\u201d only when the letter came, in the course of the meeting, to my and to arafat, only then did i sign the hebron agreement.
p230
aVor rather, ratify it, it had already been signed.
p231
aVwhy does this matter?
p232
aVbecause at that moment i actually stopped the oslo accord.
p233
aViran took dozens of americans hostage in tehran, murdered hundreds of american soldiers, marines, in beirut, and was responsible for killing and maiming thousands of american service men and women in iraq and afghanistan.
p234
aVbeyond the middle east, iran attacks america and its allies through its global terror network.
p235
aVit blew up the jewish community center and the israeli embassy in buenos aires.
p236
aVit helped al-qaeda bomb u.s. embassies in africa.
p237
aVit even attempted to assassinate the saudi ambassador, right here in washington, d.c. in the middle east, iran now dominates four arab capitals, baghdad, damascus, beirut and sanaa.
p238
aVand if iran's aggression is left unchecked, more will surely follow.
p239
aVso, at a time when many hope that iran will join the community of nations, iran is busy gobbling up the nations.
p240
aVwe must all stand together to stop iran's march of conquest, subjugation and terror.
p241
aVwe cannot accept the fact that jews wouldn't be entitled to live and buy anywhere in jerusalem.
p242
aVi can only imagine what would happen if someone suggested jews could not live in certain neighborhoods in new york, london, paris or rome.
p243
aVthere would certainly be a major international outcry.
p244
aVamos regev, the editor-[in-chif] of , is a personal friend and my conversations with him are not within the framework of my job.
p245
aVas hamas's charter makes clear, hamas's immediate goal is to destroy israel.
p246
aVbut hamas has a broader objective.
p247
aVthey also want a caliphate.
p248
aVhamas shares the global ambitions of its fellow militant islamists.
p249
aVthat\u2019s why its supporters wildly cheered in the streets of gaza as thousands of americans were murdered on 9/11.
p250
aVand that's why its leaders condemned the united states for killing osama bin laden, whom they praised as a holy warrior.
p251
aVhatred of the jews has changed form but it still remains.
p252
aVif not racial superiority, then religious superiority is the order of the day.
p253
aVthe world's indifference in light of this hatred has also remained.
p254
aVthe world has very quickly become accustomed to hearing declarations only 65 years after the holocaust, declarations of intent to annihilate millions of jews \u2013 and the world continues to act in the same manner.
p255
aVthe hesitancy of enlightened countries to act against extreme regimes which threaten us and threaten world peace \u2013 this too has not changed.
p256
aVthe only thing that has truly changed is our ability and our determination to act to defend ourselves and prevent another holocaust.
p257
aVthis truth is a source of heavy and constant responsibility \u2013 to ensure by any means necessary the future and security of the state of israel against those who seek our destruction.
p258
aVthis is the last will and testament of the six million, our brothers and sisters who perished in the holocaust and it is our duty \u2013 and we will carry it out.
p259
aVinnocent and impoverished palestinians were denied vital aid supplied from nations around the world, stole critical support for palestinian children so that they could kill our children\u2026i express my deepest sympathy with innocent palestinians and those well-meaning nations who generously donated money to help them.
p260
aVthe difference between us is that we're using missile defense to protect our civilians and they're using their civilians to protect their missiles.
p261
aVin our time the biblical prophecies are being realized.
p262
aVas the prophet amos said, they shall rebuild ruined cities and inhabit them.
p263
aVthey shall plant vineyards and drink their wine.
p264
aVthey shall till gardens and eat their fruit.
p265
aVand i will plant them upon their soil never to be uprooted again.
p266
aVladies and gentlemen, the people of israel have come home never to be uprooted again.
p267
aVwe'll attack anyone who tries to harm our citizens.
p268
aVin recent days we witness attempts to break this coexistence apart.
p269
aVtoday, for example, i have heard of an attempt to move a woman from her seat on a bus.
p270
aVi oppose this unequivocally.
p271
aVi believe we must not allow margins groups to break our common denominator and we must keep our public spaces open and safe for all of our citizens.
p272
aVwe must find the uniting and mediating ground rather than the things that divide and separate us.
p273
aVevery time an arab leader truly wanted peace, they got it.
p274
aVif the palestinians truly want peace, we will make peace.
p275
aVthe czech republic stood with the u.s., canada and a handful of other countries against the prevailing international current, but history has shown us time and again that what is right is not what is popular.
p276
aVhitler didn't want to exterminate the jews at the time.
p277
aVhe wanted to expel the jews.
p278
aVthe labeling of products of the jewish state by the european union brings back dark memories.
p279
aVeurope should be ashamed of itself.
p280
aVit took an immoral decision.
p281
aVof the hundreds of territorial conflicts around the world, it chose to single out israel and israel alone, while it's fighting with its back against the wall against the wave of terror.
p282
aVfortunately, president obama and most world leaders understand that the idea that iran's goal is not to develop nuclear weapons is ridiculous.
p283
aVyet incredibly, some are prepared to accept an idea only slightly less preposterous: that we should accept a world in which the ayatollahs have atomic bombs.
p284
aVsure, they say, iran is cruel, but it's not crazy.
p285
aVit's detestable but it's deterrable.
p286
aVresponsible leaders should not bet the security of their countries on the belief that the world's most dangerous regime won't use the world's most dangerous weapons.
p287
aVand i promise you that as prime minister, i will never gamble with the security of israel.
p288
aVfrom the beginning, the ayatollah regime has broken every international rule and flouted every norm.
p289
aVit has seized embassies, targeted diplomats and sent its own children through mine fields.
p290
aVit hangs gays and stones women.
p291
aVit supports assad's brutal slaughter of the syrian people.
p292
aViran is the world's foremost sponsor of terror.
p293
aVit sponsors hezbollah in lebanon, hamas in gaza and terrorists throughout the middle east, africa, and south america.
p294
aViran's proxies have dispatched hundreds of suicide bombers, planted thousands of roadside bombs, and fired over twenty thousand missiles at civilians.
p295
aVthrough terror from the skies and terror on the ground, iran is responsible for the murder of hundreds, if not thousands, of americans.
p296
aVin 1983, iran's proxy hezbollah blew up the marine barracks in lebanon, killing 240 american servicemen.
p297
aVin the last decade, its been responsible for murdering and maiming american soldiers in afghanistan and iraq.
p298
aVjust a few months ago, it tried to assassinate the saudi ambassador in a restaurant just a few blocks from here.
p299
aVthe assassins didn't care that several senators and members of congress would have been murdered in the process.
p300
aViran accuses the american government of orchestrating 9/11, and it denies the holocaust.
p301
aViran brazenly calls for israel's destruction, and they work for its destruction \u2013 each day, every day.
p302
aVthis is how iran behaves today, without nuclear weapons.
p303
aVthink of how they will behave tomorrow, with nuclear weapons.
p304
aViran will be even more reckless and far more dangerous.
p305
aVthe art of politics and the idea of cohering interests.
p306
aVit doesn't matter if justice is on your side.
p307
aVyou have to depict your position as just.
p308
aVif diplomacy has any chance to work, it must be coupled with a credible military threat.
p309
aVhistory has shown us time and again that what is right is not what is popular.
p310
aVwe are benefiting from one thing, and that is the attacks on the twin towers and the pentagon and the american struggle in iraq.
p311
aVthese events swung american public opinion in our favor\u000a\u000aif the arabs put down their weapons today, there would be no more violence.
p312
aVif the jews put down their weapons today, there would be no more israel\u000a\u000athe world should be very clear about making sure that iran does not get nuclear weapons, period.
p313
aVi think placing preconditions before negotiations is the quickest way to undermine peace.
p314
aVthere's an abiding interest by the united states, by the american people, and by anybody with his eyes set in his head, to prevent iran from developing nuclear weapons.
p315
aVisrael has always been pro-american.
p316
aVisrael will always be pro-american.
p317
aVpeace is purchased from strength.
p318
aVit's not purchased from weakness or unilateral retreats.
p319
aVif we accept the notion that terrorists will have immunity because as they fire on civilians they hide behind civilians, then this tactic will be legitimized and the terrorists will have their greatest victory.
p320
aVi don't think israel can accept an iranian terror base next to its major cities any more than the united states could accept an al qaeda base next to new york city.
p321
aVi will say that i think israel enjoys strong bipartisan support in the united states.
p322
aVit's really above and beyond american politics.
p323
aVisrael is so tiny.
p324
aVit's, you know, a little less than the length of manhattan, without the west bank, without judea and samaria.
p325
aVisrael has, enjoys bipartisan support - both democrats and republicans - and we extend bipartisan hospitality to both democrats and republicans.
p326
aVisrael produces more conceptual products than any other country.
p327
aVthe application of military force, or the prospect of such application, inhibits terrorist violence.
p328
aVpopulism is dangerous.
p329
aVthe greatest threat facing humanity is a radical islamist regime meeting up with nuclear weapons.
p330
aVi'm not consumed with political machinations.
p331
aVi'm not naturally manipulative.
p332
aVi've been right more than i've been wrong.
p333
aVmy level of intervention in the press, trying to control stories, is zero.
p334
aVsubzero.
p335
aVthe relationship between israel and the united states is a bond of - it's just a very powerful bond.
p336
aVit was, it is, and will be and will continue to be.
p337
aVi'm the prime minister who removed 400 checkpoints, barriers, road-blocks and so on to facilitate the growth of the palestinian economy.
p338
aVi say that to my colleagues, by the way, in the internal cabinet meetings, i say, 'look, i want to be very clear about what i want.'
p339
aVi just - i don't want a peace process, i want a peace result.
p340
aVyou know, i said in the u.n., i said to president abbas, 'look, we're in the same city, we're in the same building, for god's sake, the u.n. let's just sit down and begin to talk peace.'
p341
aVso i think we should stay focused on the real problem in the middle east.
p342
aVit's not israel.
p343
aVit's these dictatorships that are developing nuclear weapons with the specific goal of wiping israel away.
p344
aVthe obama presidency has two great missions: fixing the economy, and preventing iran from gaining nuclear weapons.
p345
aVi always lose the election in the polls, and i always win it on election day.
p346
aVi think that a strong israel is the only israel that will bring the arabs to the peace table.
p347
aVi'm a proud member of the rabble.
p348
aVi am certain that i speak on behalf of my entire nation when i say: september 11th we are all americans - in grief, as in defiance.
p349
aVpeace is something very dear.
p350
aVif you've been through wars and operations and battles, you want peace.
p351
aVthe state of israel can be proud of what we're doing.
p352
aVyou know, i'm just not going to get into american politics.
p353
aVas far as a nuclear weapons-free zone, you know, when the lion lies down with the lamb, and you don't need a new lamb every day to satisfy the lion, then we might have this kind of transformation in the middle east.
p354
aVthere is a fundamental situation in which the country has reached rock bottom, that a mother can't send her children out of the house in the morning.
p355
aVthe country has reached rock bottom and this needs to be changed.
p356
aVsome will criticize me no matter what i do.
p357
aVyou can only end a negotiation for peace if you begin it.
p358
aVour policy is very simple.
p359
aVthe jewish state was set up to defend jewish lives, and we always reserve the right to defend ourselves.
p360
aVyou don't have people chanting 'death to america' in israel.
p361
aVwhy are we talking about talking?
p362
aVwhy negotiating about negotiating?
p363
aVit's very simple.
p364
aVif you want to get to peace, put all your preconditions on the side, sit down opposite a table, not in a studio, by the way.
p365
aVyou can't end negotiations unless you begin them.
p366
aVand you can't begin them if you continually negotiate about the terms to begin negotiations.
p367
aVwe don't point a pistol at our own forehead.
p368
aVthat is not the way to conduct negotiations.
p369
aVwe want israel as a democratic and jewish state.
p370
aVso you have to maintain a jewish majority, and you want to do that by legal means, by democratic means.
p371
aVthere's no one in israel who appreciates more than me the importance of american support for israel.
p372
aVthe purpose of the jewish state is to secure the jewish future.
p373
aVthat is why israel must always have the ability to defend itself, against any threat.
p374
aVfirst of all, arafat is wrong.
p375
aVjerusalem is israel's capital, will never be divided, and will remain the capital of the state of israel, the capital of the jewish people, for ever and ever.
p376
aVi often hear them accuse israel of judaizing jerusalem.
p377
aVthat's like accusing america of americanizing washington, or the british of anglicizing london.
p378
aVyou know why we're called 'jews'?
p379
aVbecause we come from judea.
p380
aVi don't want to govern the palestinians.
p381
aVi don't want them as subjects of israel or as citizens of israel.
p382
aVi want them to have their own independent state but a demilitarized state.
p383
aVthe right combination is between a free economy and social policy that addresses the needs of society and creates equal opportunity.
p384
aVthose in the international community that refuse to put red lines before iran don't have a moral right to place a red light before israel.
p385
aVi can tell you one thing, iran is closer to developing nuclear weapons today than it was a week ago, or a month ago or a year ago.
p386
aVit's just moving on with its efforts.
p387
aVthe u.s. has a stronger military than israel, but, but don't short-change israel, either.
p388
aVdon't short-change them.
p389
aVthe iranian acquisition of nuclear weapons would be infinitely more costly than any scenario you can imagine to stop it.
p390
aVi think that peace will require two states, a palestinian state that recognizes the jewish state.
p391
aVthe rules of engagement have become so rigid that governments often straightjacket themselves in the face of unambiguous aggression.
p392
aVwe're willing to make difficult and hard decisions and compromises to live in peace with our neighbours, but we're entitled to our own country where jews from around the world can come here, just as palestinians from around the world can come to the palestinian state.
p393
aVhezbollah-controlled lebanon now presides over the un security council.
p394
aVthis means, in effect, that a terror organization presides over the body entrusted with guaranteeing the world's security.
p395
aVyou couldn't make this thing up.
p396
aVbut so far, you know who's been violating the nuclear nonproliferation pact day and night?
p397
aVthose who signed it.
p398
aViran, iraq, libya and iran violates it while calling for israel's destruction and racing to develop atomic weapons to that end.
p399
aVcertainly the international community is putting a lot of pressure on iran and making clear that its nuclear program must stop.
p400
aVif it stops with the sanctions, the combinations of sanctions, diplomacy, other pressures, i, as the prime minister of israel, will be the happiest person in the world.
p401
aVnow, when we say we want peace, what we want is really for our palestinian neighbours to have a demilitarized state next to us that recognizes the jewish state.
p402
aVwe're willing to recognize their state, the palestinian state.
p403
aVbut we ask them to recognize the jewish state.
p404
aVi don't think you can rely on iran.
p405
aVi don't think you can rely on other radicals like the taliban.
p406
aVthey dispatched al qaida to bomb new york and washington.
p407
aVwhat were they thinking?
p408
aVwere they that stupid?
p409
aVthey weren't stupid.
p410
aVthere is an irrationality there, and there is madness in this method.
p411
aVand by the way, a piece of news, israel is the one country in which everyone is pro-american, opposition and coalition alike.
p412
aVand i represent the entire people of israel who say, 'thank you, america.'
p413
aVand we're friends of america, and we're the only reliable allies of america in the middle east.
p414
aVwell, this is an unfortunate part of the un institution.
p415
aVit's the - the theater of the absurd.
p416
aVit doesn't only cast israel as the villain; it often casts real villains in leading roles: gadhafi's libya chaired the un commission on human rights; saddam's iraq headed the un committee on disarmament.
p417
aVmy first name, benjamin, dates back a thousand years earlier to benjamin - binyamin - the son of jacob, who was also known as israel.
p418
aVjacob and his 12 sons roamed these same hills of judea and sumeria 4,000 years ago, and there's been a continuous jewish presence in the land ever since.
p419
aVthe palestinians want a state, but they have to give peace in return.
p420
aVwhat they're trying to do in the united nations is to get a state without giving israel peace or giving israel peace and security.
p421
aVand i think that's, that's wrong.
p422
aVthat should not succeed.
p423
aVthat should, that should fail.
p424
aVpresident abbas, you've dedicated your life to advancing the palestinian cause.
p425
aVmust this conflict continue for generations, or will we enable our children and our grandchildren to speak in years ahead of how we found a way to end it?
p426
aVthat's what we should aim for, and that's what i believe we can achieve.
p427
aVin my office in jerusalem, there's an ancient seal.
p428
aVit's a signet ring of a jewish official from the time of the bible.
p429

aVhis name was netanyahu.

aVboth peoples, both nations, deserve a nation-state of their own.

aVpalestinians, if they wish so, will go to the palestinian state; jews, if they so wish, can go to the jewish state.
p434
aVand we'll have to have security and demilitarization agreements between us.
p435
aVthe israeli government has proved over the past year its commitment to peace, both in words and deeds.
p436
aVby contrast, the palestinians are posing preconditions for renewing the diplomatic process in a way they have not done over the course of 16 years.
p437
aVmost of the approaches to peace between israel and the palestinians, have been directed at trying to resolve the most complex problems, like refugees and jerusalem, which is akin to building the pyramid from the top down.
p438
aVhappy birthday to my dear wife sara.
p439
aVthank you for all that you do for the people of israel, for our family, and for me\u000a\u000ain recent days, hamas terrorists have fired hundreds of rockets at israel's civilians.
p440
aVno other country lives under such a threat, and no country would accept such a threat.
p441
aVisrael will not tolerate the firing of rockets on our cities and towns.
p442
aVwe have therefore significantly expanded our operations against hamas and the other terrorist organizations in gaza.
p443
aVthis comes after our repeated efforts to restore calm were met with increased hamas rocket fire.
p444
aVisrael is not eager for war, but the security of our citizens is our primary consideration.
p445
aVisrael targets hamas terrorists and not innocent civilians.
p446
aVby contrast, hamas targets israeli civilians while hiding behind palestinian civilians.
p447
aVhamas, therefore, bears full responsibility for any harm that comes to israeli and palestinian civilians alike.
p448
aVwe are determined to give our citizens the safety and security they deserve\u000a\u000aisrael is not bound by this deal with iran because iran continues to seek our destruction.
p449
aVwe will always defend ourselves\u000a\u000athank you - for the 1.3 million facebook friends.
p450
aVwe'll be in touch\u000a\u000athis thursday i will speak to the un general assembly.
p451
aVthe world needs to know how the citizens of israel feel about the nuclear agreement with iran and what we expect from the international community in the wake of this agreement\u000a\u000atoday in jerusalem a palestinian terrorist brutally stabbed a policeman.
p452
aVon friday a palestinian terrorist shot dead an israeli citizen.
p453
aVnot only has the palestinian authority refused to condemn these acts of violence, it continues unabashedly with its campaign of incitement against israel and israel's civilians.
p454
aVofficial palestinian propagation of violence and hatred are par for the course.
p455
aVit must be unequivocally condemned by all those who seek to advance peace.
p456
aVpeace will only come from direct negotiations between the parties, without preconditions.
p457
aVit will not come from un resolutions that are sought to be imposed from the outside\u000a\u000ameeting of prime minister benjamin netanyahu with french president franois hollande in paris.
p458
aVcanadian prime minister harper this evening at the israeli parliament: "through fire and water, canada will stand with you\u000a\u000athis was the scene in tehran last friday.
p459
aVdemonstrators burned american and israeli flags.
p460
aVcrowds yelled "death to america!
p461
aVdeath to israel!"
p462
aVand who was marching in the front?
p463
aViranian president hassan rouhani.
p464
aVmeanwhile, in vienna, world powers are conceding more and more to iran.
p465
aVthey are conceding even on issues that had been marked as red lines in the lausanne framework, which was a bad deal in its own right.
p466
aViran does not hide its intentions.
p467
aVit continues its murderous aggression, even against those with whom it is negotiating.
p468
aVperhaps there are some world powers who are prepared to accept an iran that calls for the destruction of israel.
p469
aVisrael will never accept this\u000a\u000ahow does the united nations react to iranian calls for the destruction of israel?
p470
aVsilence.
p471
aVshare this if you refuse to be silent\u000a\u000awe are in the third day of operation protective edge.
p472
aVwhile the campaign has gone as planned further stages yet await us.
p473
aVwe have struck hard at hamas and the terrorists and as long as the campaign continues we will strike at them harder.
p474
aVi would like to thank the idf, isa, and the security services for their professional, dedicated and precise actions, and express the appreciation of all israelis.
p475
aVthey are making every effort to avoid hitting civilians and innocents are hit it is because hamas is maliciously hiding behind palestinian civilians.
p476
aVas of now, the idf, isa and other security services have successfully foiled many attempted attacks against israeli citizens but a tough, complex and complicated campaign yet awaits us.
p477
aVtherefore, i call on all israelis to continue to show the strength that you have shown in these days and hours.
p478
aVthis civilian fortitude is a main component of our ability to continue operations until we finish the work of restoring quiet and security to israel's cities.
p479
aVthe most important thing for us, for all of us, is to guard the lives of all israelis and we are all working together to this end\u000a\u000athe alternative to this bad deal is not war.
p480
aVthe alternative is a better deal that would roll back iran's military nuclear program and tie the easing of restrictions on iran's nuclear program to changes in iran's behavior\u000a\u000ait's time for the world to condemn terrorism against israel in the same manner that it condemns terrorism in france and anywhere else in the world\u000a\u000athe state of israel bows its head on the passing of former prime minister ariel sharon.
p481
aVariel sharon played a central role in the struggle for the security of the state of israel over all its years.
p482
aVhe was, first and foremost, a courageous fighter and an outstanding general, and was among the idf's greatest commanders.
p483
aVfrom his youth, he served the people of israel on the battlefield.
p484
aVhe did so as a soldier in the war of independence, a commander in the sinai campaign and the six day war, and up to his decisive role in the battle over the suez canal that led to the turning point in the yom kippur war.
p485
aVhe established unit 101 and took the initiative in the war against terrorism, which became a central pillar of the state of israel.
p486
aVupon leaving the military, he continued to work on behalf of the people of israel both in his many government roles and as the 11th prime minister of the state of israel.
p487
aVhis memory will be enshrined forever in the heart of the nation\u000a\u000aisrael stands in solidarity with the united states following thursday's attack that claimed the lives of four marines.
p488
aVon behalf of the people and government of israel, i extend our deepest sympathies to the families of the victims and wish a speedy and full recovery to the wounded\u000a\u000athis afternoon my wife sara and i had a lovely visit to mount vernon, the home of george washington.

aVtoday i would also like to wish all who served in the united states armed forces a happy veterans day.

aVi salute you\u000a\u000agovernment and people of israel stand with the united states of america in marking 14 years since the terrorist attacks of 9/11.
p491
aVas we remember those who perished, we remain committed to fighting the forces of militant islam that have caused so much death and destruction both before and since that terrible day.
p492
aVour commitment is matched only by our conviction that we will prevail\u000a\u000aon this day, on behalf of the jewish people,  :i say to all those who have sought and still seek to destroy us  you have failed and you will fail\u000a\u000ai am speaking now about the security situation in israel.
p493
aVi will address the lies that the palestinian authority continues to tell\u000a\u000athis is a black day for the un.
p494
aVinstead of highlighting the fact that hamas made hostages of gazas children when it fired at israel from preschools, and dug tunnels towards israeli preschools, the un has again chosen to reproach israel that held itself to the highest moral standards in combat, as was determined just this past week by a group of senior american and european generals.
p495
aVat the same time, hamas - terror organization - is awarded immunity by the un, even though it has been proven beyond any doubt that it committed war crimes by firing from hospitals, mosques and from within un facilities.
p496
aVit turns out there is no limit to hypocrisy\u000a\u000athe upcoming election offers an important contrast between left and right.
p497
aVwe must focus on the security of our great nation.

p500
aVwe will do so by a policy of preventive action and strong reaction against those who try to harm us or who harm us.
p501
aVi suggest that hamas take our policy into account\u000a\u000aahead of israel's upcoming 66th independence day next week, prime minister benjamin netanyahu, today, visited the staffs of the security services of the state of israel, including the mossad, the isa, the idf and the atomic energy commission.
p502
aVprime minister netanyahu thanked the men and women of the security services for their work and noted that israel can celebrate its independence thanks to the dedicated personnel in the security establishment who work day and night so that the state of israel can stand strong in the face of the threats around us\u000a\u000ai am now leaving on an important trip to the us where i will meet with president barack obama.
p503
aVwe will discuss the iranian issue and the diplomatic process.
p504
aVi will stand steadfast on the state of israel's vital interests, especially the security of israel's citizens.
p505
aVin recent years the state of israel has been under various pressures.
p506
aVwe have rejected them in the face of the unprecedented storm and unrest in the region and are maintaining stability and security.
p507
aVthis is what has been and what will be\u000a\u000aprime minister benjamin netanyahu made today the following remarks while touring the sports complex being built in jerusalem: "today, not far from here, in the palestinian authority, they are marking what they call nakba day.
p508
aVthey stand silent in order to commemorate the disaster of the establishment of israel, the state of the jewish people.
p509
aVthey educate their children, with endless propaganda, that the state of israel needs to disappear.
p510
aVwe have many responses to this.
p511
aVthe first response is that we are continuing to build up our state and our united capital, jerusalem.
p512
aVwe will also give another response to the nakba: we will pass the nationality law that makes it clear to the entire world that israel is the state of the jewish people\u000a\u000athe greatest danger to humanity would be to let extremists have nuclear weapons\u000a\u000aprime minister benjamin netanyahu sharply condemns abu mazen's condolence letter to the family of yehuda glick's would-be assassin.
p513
aV"when we are trying to calm the situation, abu mazen sends condolences over the death of one who tried to perpetrate a reprehensible murder.
p514
aVthe time has come for the international community to condemn him for such actions," the prime minister said\u000a\u000alive broadcast: watch my speech to the un general assembly\u000a\u000a39 years of longing.
p515
aVyoni, my beloved brother and eternal hero, i miss you every day\u000a\u000awe are constantly fighting isis, jabhat - al nusra and other terrorist organizations.
p516
aVyesterday an israeli civilian crossed our border in the golan heights into syria to join the ranks of the enemy.
p517
aVwe will act to nullify his citizenship.
p518
aVthat is what is done in any such case.
p519
aVwhoever joins the ranks of the enemy to fight against israel, will not be an israeli citizen\u000a\u000airan, the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism, is squeezing more and more concessions from world powers meeting in vienna.
p520
aVi have no doubt that iran will use some of the hundreds of billions of dollars that it will receive in sanctions relief in order to expand its global terror network.
p521
aVwhy should we expect otherwise?
p522
aViran's ultimate goal is not to become part of the community of nations, but to take over the world.
p523
aVagainst all odds:a great victory for the likud.
p524
aVa major victory for the people of israel\u000a\u000alast night i presented michael douglas with the 2015 genesis prize.
p525
aVmichael won the prize not only because of his professional achievements, but also because of his connection to jewish tradition, his love for the jewish people, and his passion for the jewish state.
p526
aVmichael is a true friend of israel.
p527
aVhe has used his public influence to take a clear stand against anti-semitism, and he has correctly described the bds movement as an "ugly cancer."
p528
aVindeed, rather than suppressing his jewish identity, michael has embraced it  and encouraged his family to do the same.
p529
aVi was moved by his son dylan's desire to celebrate his bar mitzvah in israel, and i look forward to welcoming the entire family again to jerusalem when his daughter carys celebrates her bat mitzvah here.
p530
aVmichael plans to direct his prize money to organizations that promote inclusiveness and diversity in judaism.
p531
aVi want to emphasize: as prime minister of israel, i'm committed to strengthening the unity of the jewish people, and i will continue to reject any attempt to divide the jewish people and to delegitimize any jewish community.
p532
aVeveryone is welcome in israel  reform, conservative, orthodox alike.
p533
aVeveryone.
p534
aVmichael, i applaud you for all of your accomplishments, and for the impact you will certainly have in the years ahead in fulfilling your role as a genesis laureate.
p535
aVi applaud you for coming to jerusalem, our capital for 3,000 years, where we are shaping our future while remembering our past.
p536
aVi applaud you  and i think this is the most important thing  for setting an example to jews everywhere to stand tall and stand proud.
p537
aVshabbat shalom.
p538
aVthe deal with iran was a dream deal for iran but a nightmare deal for the world.
p539
aVwhen you are willing to make an agreement at any cost, this is the result.
p540
aVfrom the initial reports we can already conclude that this agreement is an historic mistake for the world.
p541
aVfar-reaching concessions have been made in all areas that were supposed to prevent iran from obtaining nuclear weapons capability.
p542
aVin addition, iran will receive hundreds of billions of dollars with which it can fuel its terror machine and its expansion and aggression throughout the middle east and across the globe.
p543
aVone cannot prevent an agreement when the negotiators are willing to make more and more concessions to those who, even during the talks, keep chanting: 'death to america.'
p544
aVwe knew very well that the desire to sign an agreement was stronger than anything, and therefore we did not commit to preventing an agreement.
p545
aVwe did commit to preventing iran from acquiring nuclear weapons, and this commitment still stands\u000a\u000afunds that were intended to building kindergartens for gaza's children were instead used by hamas to build tunnels of terror to strike at israeli kindergartens\u000a\u000athe iranian weapons ship reached israel last night.
p546
aVthe operation to seize the ship had two goals: preventing the delivery of deadly weapons to terrorist organizations in the gaza strip, which would have directly endangered israel's citizens, and exposing the true face of iran, which was behind this weapons shipment.
p547
aViran completely denies its involvement; it is lying in the most brazen manner.
p548
aVwe will present evidence of this tomorrow and later.
p549
aVi call this to the attention of catherine ashton, who is now visiting tehran.
p550
aVi would like to ask her if she asked her iranian hosts about this shipment of weapons for terrorist organizations, and if not, why not.
p551
aVnobody has the right to ignore the true and murderous actions of the regime in tehran.
p552
aVi think that it would be proper for the international community to give its opinion regarding iran's true policy, not its propaganda\u000a\u000awe are changing our policy and declaring war against those who throw stones and firebombs.
p553
aVwe will give our soldiers and police officers the tools that they need in order to implement this new policy as soon as possible\u000a\u000ato the israeli police officers and security forces in the field: you have my full backing and the full backing of the people of israel to take decisive action in order to save lives and to protect yourselves.
p554
aVthank you all for watching over us.
p555
aVtake care of yourselves\u000a\u000aprime minister benjamin netanyahu convened a security consultation this afternoon at israel police headquarters in jerusalem.
p556
aVprime minister netanyahu was briefed on last night's vehicular terrorist attack in jerusalem and on the disturbances that have occurred in jerusalem in recent months.
p557
aVhe directed that sovereignty be asserted in all parts of the city via the stationing of additional forces throughout the city.
p558
aVprime minister netanyahu met with the jerusalem district police officer who shot the terrorist and asked to send his condolences to the family of three-month-old chaya zissel braun who was murdered in the attack: "on behalf of the entire nation, i send condolences to the family of this pure baby and my wishes for a quick and full recovery to those who were wounded."
p559
aVprime minister netanyahu added, "united jerusalem was - and will remain - israel's eternal capital.
p560
aVall attempts to attack its residents will be met with a very sharp reaction; we will restore quiet and security to jerusalem.
p561
aVto this end i have directed that reinforcements be brought in, including additional border police units, which are moving in today, as well as with lookouts, intelligence and enforcement measures.
p562
aVthese, along with other steps that i will not detail here, can and will restore quiet to the capital.
p563
aVi rely on the people sitting here.
p564
aVwe will support the israel police and give it whatever reinforcements and capabilities it needs to carry out this mission.
p565
aVwe have proven that with determination and patience we can achieve these goals in all parts of the state of israel.
p566
aVnot only is jerusalem under terrorist attack but other capitals and cities around the world are as well.
p567
aVbut the attacks in jerusalem are supported by palestinian authority chairman abu mazen, who both extols the murderers and embraces the organization that the terrorists belong to, hamas.
p568
aVand against these actions by the palestinian authority chairman, we find international weakness; they are not prepared to utter so much as a word of criticism against him.
p569
aVwe have no such weakness.
p570
aVwe will insist on our rights and on our obligation to defend our capital.
p571
aVwe will do strongly - and we will win."
p572
aVhow much light kaiya has brought into our home!
p573
aVif you are thinking of getting a canine, find an adult dog to rescue.
p574
aVyou won't regret it\u000a\u000athe bottom line of this very bad deal is exactly what iran's president rouhani said today: "the international community is removing the sanctions and iran is keeping its nuclear program."
p575
aVby not dismantling iran's nuclear program, in a decade this deal will give an unreformed, unrepentant and far richer terrorist regime the capacity to produce many nuclear bombs, in fact an entire nuclear arsenal with the means to deliver it.
p576
aVwhat a stunning historic mistake!
p577
aVdo you agree?
p578
aVshare my full statement.
p579
aVthe world needs to know\u000a\u000athis morning, 232 new immigrants arrived in israel from the united states on an el al charter flight organized by nefesh b'nefesh, in cooperation with the ministry of immigrant absorption and the jewish agency for israel.
p580
aVfrom this group, 59 young people will be joining the israel defense forces.
p581
aVto the soon-to-be soldiers: i salute you.
p582
aVto all the new citizens: welcome home.
p583
aVthe people of israel are so proud of you.
p584
aVwe have only one land  the land of israel.
p585
aVwe are guarding it and thwarting terror attacks, as we did yesterday in jenin.
p586
aVwe are responding to all fire on our territory, in ways seen and in ways unseen.
p587
aVmy policy against terrorism is clear: zero restraint, zero let-up, zero tolerance for terrorism\u000a\u000awatch and share:  prime minister benjamin netanyahu was interviewed today by cbs's face the nation and fox news sunday, regarding operation "protective edge\u000a\u000athe best way to guarantee peace is to be strong.
p588
aVand thats what the people of israel expect me to do  to stand strong against criticism, against pressure, stand strong to secure the future of the one and only jewish state\u000a\u000atwo things that happened today: 1. iranian supreme leader ali khamenei tweeted a video calling for the destruction of israel, a un member state.
p589
aV2. the un security council voted to lift sanctions on iran.
p590
aVthe hypocrisy knows no bounds.
p591
aVthe best way to fight this hypocrisy is to tell the truth in a strong and unified manner\u000a\u000ai said to the jewish federations' general assembly: the only way to fight lies is by telling the truth.
p592
aVwe have nothing to be ashamed of.
p593
aVstand proud and tell the truth about israel\u000a\u000athere are elements in europe that rush to condemn the construction of a flat in jerusalem but do not rush to condemn  or offer only weak condemnations of  the murder of jews here or in europe itself and, even worse, welcome unity with a terrorist element such as hamas, which calls for the destruction of the state of israel.
p594
aVwe oppose such hypocrisy, we protest against it, we will continue to always state the truth, we will continue to fight terrorism and we will continue to build up our state\u000a\u000ashare this: these are the employees of an israeli pharmaceutical company in ashdod.
