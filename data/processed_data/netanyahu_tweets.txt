POTUS Those who threaten us with annihilation put themselves in mortal peril

POTUS Israels policy on the Iran deal is very simple: Fix it or nix it. Above all, fixing the deal means getting rid of the sunset clause

POTUS rightly called the nuclear deal with Iran an embarrassment. I couldnt agree with him more. Iran vows to destroy my country every day

President Abbas: stop poisoning the minds of Palestinian youth. Educate for peace, not terror

Not surprisingly, President Abbas's Fatah movement claimed responsibility for Friday's lethal stabbing of an Israeli policewoman

Naming yet another public square for a mass murderer teaches Palestinian youngsters to murder Israelis. Thats the very opposite of peace

who planned the 1974 Maalot massacre in which Palestinian terrorists murdered 22 school children and 4 adults

Last week, the Palestinian Authority named a public square after Khaled Nazzal, a Palestinian terrorist chief

PM: This is a common effort that all of us have to make against these Islamist terrorist groups that threaten our societies &amp; civilization

gt; they turn their attention &amp; their investigative committees against these terrorists who trample every norm on which the UN was founded. &gt;

PM Netanyahu: I think the UN would do itself a great favour if instead of the automatic Israel bashing, &gt;

At the same time, Hamas withdrew from all of its demands for a ceasefire, with neither time constraints nor other conditions

PM Netanyahu: We hit the Hamas command centers and delivered blows that Hamas has not experienced since it was founded

The IDF &amp; the ISA killed almost 1000 terrorists, struck at the heads of the orgs, at their network of tunnels and terrorist high-rises

This is what we have done this time as well. We struck Hamas very hard

and we have always fought vigorously, and with strength, against those who wish to destroy us, while building up our state

We will continue to be steadfast and united until we achieve the goals of the campaign  the restoration of quiet&amp;security for all Israelis

Hamas knows that we are very strong. Maybe it thinks we do not have enough determination and patience, and here it is making a big mistake

As long as quiet is not restored, Hamas will continue to take very harsh blows. If it thinks that we cannot stand up to it, it is mistaken

If Hamas thinks that continued sporadic firing will cause us to make concessions, it is mistaken

If Hamas thinks that it can cover up its military loss with a diplomatic achievement, it is mistaken

We destroyed its  of tunnels, intercepted the rockets &amp; foiled the terrorist attacks it tried to perpetrate against Israeli civilians

Only with a clear response to our security needs will we agree to reach understandings. Hamas has taken a severe military blow

The Prime Minister added that Hamas conceals ammunition in schools and fires it at schools in Israel

PM Netanyahu spoke w/ UN Sec Gen Ban Ki-moon and asked him to publish photos showing the munitions that were hidden in a UN school in Gaza

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke yesterday with US President Barack Obama. http://t.co/Kqy1lTII5T

The supreme consideration that guides us is to restore the security to Israel's citizens and to restore quiet to the country

gt; and with the understanding that without action, the price that we would pay would be much greater

In both cases, Hamas continued firing. We chose to commence this operation after we had exhausted the other possibilities, &gt;

Last night's operation came after Israel agreed to the Egyptian ceasefire proposal and to the UN initiative for a humanitarian truce

My instructions to the IDF, w/approval of the Security Cabinet, are to be ready for the possibility of an expansion of the ground operation

To our sorrow, a soldier has already fallen and I send condolences to his family. I am certain that I speak on behalf of all Israelis

Even here there is no guarantee of 100% success, but we are doing our utmost in order to achieve the maximum

Because it is not possible to deal with the tunnels only from the air, our soldiers are now doing so on the ground

in order to perpetrate a large scale attack against Israel's citizens. The IDF successfully thwarted this terrorist act

I remind you that it was through such a tunnel that Hamas terrorists infiltrated into our territory yesterday morning

Last night, our forces commenced a ground operation in order to strike at the terrorist tunnels from the Gaza Strip into Israeli territory

The IDF is operating against Hamas and the other terrorist organizations in the Gaza Strip from the sea and air, and now on land as well

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu today at the Cabinet meeting: This is the 10th day that Israel's cities have been under terrorist attack

while inflicting a significant blow to the infrastructures of Hamas and the other terrorist organizations

Operation Protective Edge will continue until it reaches its goal  restoring quiet to Israel's citizens for a prolonged period

In light of Hamas' criminal &amp; relentless aggression, and the dangerous infiltration attempt into Israel - Israel must  defend its citizens

Hamas also did not honor the humanitarian ceasefire initiated by the UN and continued firing at Israeli cities during the lull

whereas Hamas rejected the cease fire proposal and continued firing rockets at Israeli cities

The directive for ground action was approved by the Security Cabinet after Israel agreed to the Egyptian ceasefire proposal

Prime Minister Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yaalon also instructed the IDF to be prepared for an expansion of the ground action

The IDF successfully thwarted this terrorist action

Hamas terrorists used such a tunnel to infiltrate into Israel today in order to perpetrate a large-scale attack against Israeli citizens

I ask that the public continue to listen to the instructions from IDF Home Front Command  they save lives

The operation will be expanded and will continue until the firing at our communities stops and quiet is restored

We are all united in the mission to strike at the terrorist organizations and restore quiet

Our military is strong, the home front is steadfast and our people are united. This is our response to the terrorist orgs that attack us

Hamas will pay a heavy price for firing at Israel's citizens. The security of Israel's citizens is our primary consideration

We decided to further increase the assault on Hamas and the terrorist orgs in Gaza. The IDF is prepared for all possibilities

Israel targets Hamas terrorists. By contrast Hamas targets innocent Isareli civilians civilians while hiding behind civilians

Israel is not eager for war but the security of our citizens is our primary consideration

This comes after our repeated efforts to restore calm were met with increased Hamas rocket fire

We have therefore significantly expanded our operations against Hamas and the other terrorist organizations in Gaza

No other country lives under such a threat. Israel will not tolerate the firing of rockets on our cities and towns

In recent days, Hamas terrorists have fired hundreds of rockets at Israel's civilians

RT @IsraeliPM: Video: Statement by PM Netanyahu upon the launch of operation #ProtectiveEdge (English captions available) http://t.co/P30q8

I would like to send my great appreciation to the police personnel and soldiers for tirelessly dealing with the security of all Israelis

I call on the leaders of the Arab public to show responsibility and come out against the disturbances in order to restore quiet

One cannot benefit from National Insurance payments&amp;child allowances and at the same time violate the most basic laws of the State of Israel

There's no place for incitement against the existence of the State of Israel. Whoever does not abide by the law will be punished severely

There is no place in the State of Israel for stone-throwing at police, throwing firebombs, blocking roads, destroying property

We are taking a tough line against anyone who breaks the law and against inciters from whatever side

Over the weekend we also took determined action against disturbances in Jerusalem and in Arab communities

Experience proves that at such times we must act responsibly&amp;with equanimity. We will do whatever is necessary to restore quiet and security

The goal of all of our operations is to restore quiet and security to all of Israel's citizens, especially the residents of the south

PM at the Cabinet meeting: We are working on several fronts simultaneously. Overnight we were active against many Hamas targets in Gaza

way home to their parents who will not see them anymore. Hamas is responsible and Hamas will pay. May the memories of the 3 boys be blessed

Vengeance for the blood of a small child, Satan has not yet created. Neither has vengeance for the blood of 3 pure youths who were on their&gt;

the mothers, fathers, grandmothers and grandfathers, and brothers and sisters  we are deeply saddened, the entire nation weeps with you

They were abducted &amp; murdered in cold blood by human animals. On behalf of the entire Jewish People, I would like to tell the dear families

PM at the Cabinet meeting: With heavy grief we found 3 bodies. All signs indicate they are of our abducted youths Eyal, Gilad and Naftali

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu added that the ayatollahs' regime must not be allowed to have a nuclear bomb

gt; in contrast to the apparent agreement with Iran that includes leaving capabilities under supervision

This touches on the roots of the conflict and the roots of a solution in which peace is achieved between us and the Palestinians

Therefore, international pressure must be applied on Abu Mazen to dissolve the partnership with Hamas

It is with this Hamas that Abu Mazen chose to form an alliance last week. Instead of issuing statements to placate global public opinion

Hamas denies the Holocaust even as it attempts to create an additional Holocaust by destroying the State of Israel

In addition to its effort to arm itself with nuclear weapons, Iran arms, finances and trains Hamas and other terrorist orgs on our borders

Abu Mazen violated existing agreements by unilaterally applying to accede to international treaties and then formed an alliance with Hamas

Abu Mazen has refused to even discuss recognizing Israel as the national state of the Jewish People

Only last month Abu Mazen rejected the framework principles proposed by the United States

This agreement is the direct continuation of the Palestinians' refusal to advance the negotiations

The agreement between Abu Mazen and Hamas was signed even as Israel is making efforts to advance the negotiations with the Palestinians

Hamas has fired over 10,000 missiles and rockets at Israeli territory and has not halted terrorist actions against Israel even for a minute

He established Unit 101 and took the initiative in the war against terrorism, which became a central pillar of the State of Israel

campaign and the 6 Day War and up to his decisive role in the battle over the Suez Canal that led to the turning point in the Yom Kippur War

From youth, he served the people of Israel on the battlefield. He did so as a soldier in the War of Independence, a commander in the Sinai

He was, first and foremost, a courageous fighter and an outstanding general, and was among the IDF's greatest commanders

The agreement reduces the pressure on Iran w/o receiving anything tangible in return &amp; the Iranians themselves say this deal saved them. 3/3

True, the intl pressure we applied was partly successful and led to a better result than originally planned but this is still a bad deal 2/3

I would be happy if I could join those voices around the world that are praising the Geneva agreement. 1/3

Without continued pressure, what incentive does Iran have to take serious steps that actually dismantle its nuclear weapons capability? 5/5

Iran is taking only cosmetic steps that could easily reversed, and in return, sanctions that took years to put in place will be eased. 4/5

Israel is prepared to live in peace with a #Palestinian state, but for #peace to endure, Israels security must be protected

Statements by PM #Netanyahu and US Secretary of State #Hillary #Clinton http://t.co/DEug0Pds

For #Hamas, every time there are civilian casualties, thats an operational success http://t.co/tf84WCzZ

Hamas and the other #terror organizations in #Gaza have no compunction whatsoever at firing on our civilians while hiding behind civilians

and reaching the audiences that you are getting to is a significant bonus for the State of Israel

The fact that you are focusing on rebutting the entire falsehood industry

I would like to thank all the citizens of #Israel and all over the #world who are taking part in the national information effort

The #operation in the #Gaza Strip is continuing and we are prepared to expand it. We will continue doing everything to protect our citizens

PM Netanyahu's Remarks at the Start of the Weekly Cabinet Meeting http://t.co/yCGQiXlz

The #terrorists in #Gaza are committing a double #war #crime. They fire at Israeli civilians, and they hide behind #Palestinian civilians

We are exacting a heavy price from Hamas and the terrorist organizations. The IDF is prepared for a significant expansion of its operations

Last night I talked with the #President of the United States #Barack #Obama 
http://t.co/OBD2IAzf

No country in the world would have agreed to a situation where its population lives under the perpetual threat of missiles

Hamas deliberately targets our children, and they deliberately place their rockets next to their children

We are going to continue hitting #Hamas hard and we will continue to strike hard at the missiles targeted at Central and Southern Israel

Hamas deliberately targets our children, and they deliberately place their rockets next to their children

This year alone, the fired over one thousand rockets and missiles at Israel, included close to 200 rockets in the last 24 hours

Hamas fired thousand of rockets at our cities, at our towns, at our civilians, at our children

No government would tolerate a situation where nearly a fifth of its people live under a constant barrage of rockets and missile fire

The terrorists in #Gaza are committing a double war crime. They fire at Israeli civilians, and they hide behind Palestinian civilians

In past 24 hrs #Israel made clear it will not tolerate rocket attacks on its civilians. I hope #Hamas &amp; other terrorists in Gaza got message

I saw today a picture of a bleeding Israeli baby. #Hamas deliberately targets our children http://t.co/nnSvmZ9i http://t.co/z8orVsfE

They would simply like to wipe us off the face of the earth and they have no reservations about harming innocent civilians

We in contradistinction refrain to the extent possible from harming civilians; this is a fundamental difference between us and them

The terror organizations hurt our citizens with premeditation, while they deliberately conceal themselves behind their own citizens

Hamas and the terror organizations have elected in recent days to escalate their attacks on Israel's citizens http://t.co/IpUQevnM

No country would agree to such a situation; Israel is not prepared to reconcile itself to such a situation http://t.co/IpUQevnM
