S"The entire world celebrated the deal with North Korea. It deemed to be a great breakthrough; it would bring an end to North Korea's nuclear program; you'd have inspectors. That would do the job. And of course everybody applauded it, but it turned out to be a very, very bad deal and you know where we are with North Korea. I think the same thing would be true in the case of Iran, except that Iran is a great deal more dangerous than North Korea. It's a militant Islamic power bent on regional domination, in fact, bent on world domination, as it openly says so. They just chanted 'Death to America' a few days ago on the streets of Tehran, the same streets where they're rejoicing right now. Don\xe2\x80\x99t give the preeminent terrorist state of our time the access to a nuclear program that could help them make nuclear weapons. Its very bad for all of us."

S'Absolutely. The Middle East has undergone a tremendous convulsion. Hectic events follow one another. There is great instability because of the inherent tension within Arab societies. The fight between modernity and medievalism has not been decided and I think that effects everything that we see around us. We can see half of Palestinian society overtaken by radical Islamists supported by Iran and the other half is moving away from peace with unilateral resolutions at the UN.'

S'Before the Palestinians went to the UN, Israel threatened harsh measures in response and now you announced new settlement building between Jerusalem and Maaleh Adumin.

S'I suppose Israelis should have become used to the fact that we don\xe2\x80\x99t get a fair hearing in Europe, but we expect otherwise. Because every fair minded person knows that Israel is a beleaguered country, under attack. We\xe2\x80\x99re the only country threatened with genocide. We vacated territory right next to our cities, territory that has been taken over by the proxies of Iran, territory from which they\xe2\x80\x99ve fired thousand of rockets on our cities and from which they openly call for our destruction.Now we\xe2\x80\x99re asked to vacate more territory right next to Jerusalem, right next to Tel Aviv, without any guarantees whatsoever from the other side that they\xe2\x80\x99ll recognize the Jewish state, that the\xe2\x80\x99ll end the conflict, that we\xe2\x80\x99ll have the necessary security arrangements so that what happened in Gaza and in Lebanon when we vacated them, doesnt happen again for a third time.Yet none of this appears in the UN resolution. It is completely one-sided; it is a gross violation of the Palestinian\xe2\x80\x99s commitment not to go to the UN and to resolve issues through peace negotiations. This now has all been swept aside and of course we have to protect our vital interests, and so we\xe2\x80\x99re doing that. But the fact that the Palestinians tore to shreds their commitments under the Oslo Accords and went to the UN unilaterally is somehow dismissed.Our response which is measured and certainly less than proportional is blown out sky high. That\xe2\x80\x99s neither fair nor judicious, because it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t bring peace closer. It pushes it back. It hardens the Palestinian\xe2\x80\x99s positions and it tells us something very, very disturbing. It tells us there\xe2\x80\x99s no value to making agreements for peace, because when the other side violates it, nobody will hold them accountable. Only Israel, when it takes actions to protect its own interests, will be held accountable. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that encourages peace.'

S'With the swift and careful action in Gaza, it seemed that Israel had gained international credit and also the fact that it stopped before a ground invasion.

S'I disagree. They\xe2\x80\x99re talking about a Palestinian state between Gaza and the West Bank and there\xe2\x80\x99s no continuum there. Here, we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about an area that is one mile, two miles wide, that connects Jerusalem to a suburb that in all peace plans will remain part of the State of Israel. All previous Israeli governments have had the position that this suburb of Jerusalem called Maaleh Adumim, which has about 40.000 people, will be part of Israel in a final settlement deal. All governments talked about the possibility of building tunnels, bridges, roads there to facilitate Palestinian movement. So to say that this will jeopardize the possibility of a Palestinian state is neither true nor responsible. In any case what we\xe2\x80\x99ve advanced so far is only planning, and we will have to see. We shall act further based on what the Palestinians do. If they don\xe2\x80\x99t act unilaterally, then we won\xe2\x80\x99t have any purpose to do so either..'

S'I think that there\xe2\x80\x99s a willingness to believe the worst about Israel in some quarters of Europe, and that\xe2\x80\x99s something that has been part of our history in Europe for many generations. People believed outrageous things about the Jewish people, as some now believe about the Jewish state. What is our great crime? What is it we\xe2\x80\x99re doing? We\xe2\x80\x99re building in the areas that will remain in a final peace settlement of Israel. This is not some foreign land. This is the land in which the Jewish people have been for close to 4000 years.What we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about is suburbs contiguous to Jerusalem. And everybody knows that they will remain part of Israel. You don\xe2\x80\x99t change the map, you don\xe2\x80\x99t prejudge anything. I think there is heightened sensitivity. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see this heightened sensitivity from some of these governments when the Palestinians violated the Oslo Accords. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see them speaking out when President Abbas claimed solidarity with the Hamas terrorists who are rocketing Israel. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see it when they speak now of a union between Hamas and the Palestinian Authority. I don\xe2\x80\x99t hear that and I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that this is conducive to peace. I think it\xe2\x80\x99s counterproductive.I think the one-sided criticism of Israel just tells the Palestinians that they can get away with violating their solemn pledges for peace, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it advances peace. Israel is prepared to have peace with a Palestinian state. The Palestinians want a Palestinian state without peace. Many of these European governments who voted for this thinking it may advance peace but in fact this pushes peace backwards because it tells the Palestinians you can get international recognition and international legitimacy without making the necessary compromises for peace.'

S' I think maybe that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t their intention. Maybe their intention in voting for it or even abstaining was the thought that they were somehow advancing peace. In effect, the consequence was the exact opposite. What it does is it encourages the Palestinians to believe that they don\xe2\x80\x99t need to make the fundamental compromise of recognizing Israel and coming to terms with it, and they\xe2\x80\x99ll still get international recognition. That\xe2\x80\x99s not a blueprint for peace.'

S'No, it was a response to the fact that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been rocketed with rockets every fourteen days. A million of our citizens were rocketed with hundreds of rockets. No country would accept such a thing. We responded forcefully, but in a very precise way. The Palestinian terrorists in Gaza target civilians while hiding behind civilians and committing a double war crime. Israel, in response, took very precise aim at the rocketeers and rockets and we were able to achieve the end of this firing with minimal civilian casualties. That\xe2\x80\x99s the whole difference, they seek to maximize civilian casualties and we seek to minimize them. I think the difference in the methods of the two sides underlines a difference in the goals. Those who trample all human rights and are willing to slaughter civilians in masses don\xe2\x80\x99t care for human rights, they don\xe2\x80\x99t care for democracy and they don\xe2\x80\x99t care for peace. In fact Hamas and the satellite terrorist organizations in Gaza openly call for our destruction, for genocide. And they are openly supported by Iran that calls for a genocide. We seek peace and coexistence and we follow the most responsible and legitimate path of defense. They seek the very opposite.'

S'I had a very clear goal in mind when I started the operation. It was to exact a price from the Hamas terrorists for these frequent attacks on our cities, and to destroy the bulk of their long-range weapons which were aimed at Tel Aviv and Jerusalem and the sizable part of their middle-range rockets which were fired on our cities at a range of 40 kilometers. Once those goals were achieved, I said in advance in our internal cabinet deliberations, that we would advance a ceasefire. That\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what I did. But of course there was always a possibility that this would develop into a broader conflict, and for that reason we had mobilized the reserves. As it turned out, they weren\xe2\x80\x99t needed.'

What were the reasons you decided to hold back even after the Cabinet had agreed to the biggest mobilization since the Lebanon War?'

S'[Laughs] Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s a good question, but apparently not enough people are asking it because quite a few people would like to have it. I have this position not for any personal reasons, it is because I feel a deep mission to protect the Jewish people and the one and only Jewish state. We\xe2\x80\x99ve had a horrible history on the soil of Europe. Our people were murdered \xe2\x80\x93 six million of our people and from the ashes of the Holocaust, we built the state. This state is being attacked again and again by Arab states and now by Iranian-backed terrorists. And it\xe2\x80\x99s being attacked again and again with slander. In our history, including on the soil of Europe, we had a regular pattern. First the Jewish people were maligned, then they were attacked. And the maligning, the vilification served as the legitimization for the attacks that followed, and in many ways this is what is happening to the State of Israel.It is vilified again and again in public opinion, including in European public opinion, to prepare the attacks. And people don\xe2\x80\x99t know the facts. They don\xe2\x80\x99t know that we were attacked from the areas that we\xe2\x80\x99re now asked to return. They don\xe2\x80\x99t know that when we vacated territories in Gaza, once we walked out, Iran immediate walked in and they fired rockets on us. Can people seriously ask us to just walk away? To vacate all this area? Can they seriously tell us you have no connection to these areas? These areas where Abraham, Isaac and Jacob walked, where my ancestors walked, where Jews have been for thousands of years? I\xe2\x80\x99m not saying that we don\xe2\x80\x99t recognize that there\xe2\x80\x99s another people there. I do, and I want a peace with them. And I\xe2\x80\x99m prepared for them to have their own state, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to see a situation where we are completely erased, that we \xe2\x80\x93 who do not want to rule the Palestinians \xe2\x80\x93 have them establish another Iranian-backed terror state on the suburbs of Tel Aviv that threatens our very survival.'

S' If you\xe2\x80\x99ve been in battle it is not something you would want to repeat. It\xe2\x80\x99s not a pleasant experience. I myself was wounded, as you say, in a rescue effort of the hijacked Sabina airplane. First of all, it\xe2\x80\x99s not a particularly pleasant thing to be wounded by gunfire. And also, it\xe2\x80\x99s tragic to lose a brother, as I did, or a husband, or a father, or a son. Anybody who\xe2\x80\x99s been through war does their utmost to prevent war. That is something that is very, very strong, and that is why before I decide on military action, I think very carefully about the consequences. That\xe2\x80\x99s something that is very deeply ingrained.On the other hand, we also have the knowledge that if once again we become defenseless, we won\xe2\x80\x99t exist. We had no defenses before the establishment of the Jewish state, and we could be tossed like a leaf in the wind. And we were incinerated like refuse. And so the Jewish state was established, among other things, to give the Jewish people a home in their ancestral homeland, but also to give them the capacity for self-defense. Our enemies who know that they cannot defeat us on the battlefield in legitimate warfare, are using two types of weapons against us: the weapon of terror \xe2\x80\x93 rockets fired on our cities. And the weapon of lies. To describe Israel as a mighty Goliath when in fact, it\xe2\x80\x99s a David facing so many challenges from every direction, by people who are committed to our destruction.We don\xe2\x80\x99t seek to destroy them. We don\xe2\x80\x99t seek to destroy the Palestinians. We seek to live in peace with them. We don\xe2\x80\x99t use a fraction of our power because we have constraints on the use of military force. If you\xe2\x80\x99re a soldier, you know those constraints, and I do as a former soldier. But the difference is this: we seek to live in peace with our neighbors, and they seek to either eradicate us with a frontal attack, or to establish a state that will not live in peace with us. And either one is unacceptable. There is no one in Israel who wants peace more than me. I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the tragedy of war, and I know the blessings of peace. But to achieve peace you have to have a partner that is willing to sit down and negotiate. And so far, I have not been able to get such a partner. For four years, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been calling on President Abbas to sit down and negotiate. For four years, he\xe2\x80\x99s run away from responding to that call, and in fact, he just did that again by going to the UN.'

But we also see what is happening in Syria. We see Iran\xe2\x80\x99s race for nuclear weapons. We see the flow of weapons from Iran and Libya into Sinai and into Gaza, and all of this presents new challenges. We have to address the challenges as they are. This has nothing to do with Israel. It has everything to do with the inherent instability of the Middle East; the fact that liberal democratic values have not taken root there. You need to enfranchise people, politically and economically. And in many parts of the Middle East, that has not happened. Because you don\xe2\x80\x99t have economic development, I would say there is a general frustration and a rush to Islamist movements who offer easy solutions but don\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily solve anything.

Participation in the labor force is growing, and I intend to encourage it even more. As far as our education system, we introduced some dramatic reforms, upgraded our higher education that is world-renowned, and also made reforms from the pre-school age, and right up through the chain.

We\xe2\x80\x99ve had remarkable success. They\xe2\x80\x99ve come back from Harvard, Stanford, MIT, the best universities in the United States and elsewhere. We are building a new medical school in Safed in the Galilee that is going to become a world center for life sciences and the bio-medical industry. We\xe2\x80\x99ve got tremendous developments in bio-technology and cyber-technology and many other areas, and we\xe2\x80\x99ve got the most robust venture capital industry, certainly in the Eastern hemisphere. So amidst all the problems that we\xe2\x80\x99re discussing, Israel has had one rule \xe2\x80\x93 you continue to build and develop the country. We\xe2\x80\x99ve been in one form of siege or another since the establishment of the state. We continue to build the state; we continue to develop it.

They want a tough hand on security because that\xe2\x80\x99s a natural response for people who received thousands of rockets on their cities. But Israelis remain, as I do, committed to peace. What we haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen is a commensurate move from the Palestinian side, and we hope that it will happen. But even if it does happen, then this peace will have to be protected by very robust security arrangements, because we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen what has happen before. We\xe2\x80\x99ve vacated an area, gave the keys to President Abbas in Gaza, and within days, the Hamas kicked him out and Iran walked in. We can\xe2\x80\x99t have that happen again.

I think that people understand that there is a special relationship between Germany and Israel. I think that Chancellor Merkel believed that this vote would somehow advance peace. That was her goal. But in fact the opposite happened because, in the aftermath of the UN resolution, we see that the Palestinian Authority under President Abbas is moving to unite with the Hamas terrorists. The resolution did not call for recognizing the Jewish state or ending the conflict with us or having security safeguards. It has encouraged the Palestinians, actually to toughen their position and not to enter negotiations. So despite the goal of the German abstention, I think that it produced the opposite outcome.

He was of that caliber, and he wrote some magnificent histories, including a history of the Spanish Inquisition. He died last year, when he was 102, so he had a century of wisdom that he accumulated. He told me that he believed that the greatest danger to any living organism is the inability to see danger in time, which is what plagued the Jewish people a number of times in its history, including of course, before the Holocaust; and that the responsibility of leaders, of course, is to protect the people. So I\xe2\x80\x99ve taken that lesson to heart. The second thing he told me was that peace is only made with the strong. Nobody will make peace with a weak Israel; nobody will make peace with an Israel that cannot defend itself. And I think that is something that most Israelis understand instinctively. This is a very tough neighborhood, the Middle East, and we have to be able to defend ourselves in order to achieve peace. The third thing he told me, as someone who is a father who lost his son, my oldest brother, is to cherish peace, to cherish a situation where you can actually not lose loved ones. I have children of my own, I have grandchildren. I want to see them live in peace. I know that in the Middle East, the only peace that will be sustained is a peace you can defend.'

S' No.  I believe there is no truth to this, however \xe2\x80\x93 look, I did not listen to the speech, I did not see it, but I read it later.  And I understood that he gave a speech which impressed many people, both in what was said and also how they were said.  And David asked that I not respond to him, supposedly that I not say that I understand his grief, do not understand his grief.  And I truly do not want to refer to this.  I know him and we have met in the past, and probably will meet again in the future.  And we will talk and argue \xe2\x80\x93 we always argued, because David Grossman\xe2\x80\x99s opinion was always on the farther Left. And in this aspect, it endured and we disagree, but I wish to say also to David Grossman that I do not know if I remember that I have been Prime Minister exactly six months, and during those six months, many things have occurred.  Because of this, I want to say something about what happened a little more than six months ago \xe2\x80\x93 I was a shoo-in for Prime Minister \xe2\x80\x93 perhaps the first in the history of the State of Israel, who on the eve of elections said: here is my political plan, a political plan which aroused tremendous repercussions around the world.  And this cost me votes.  And when I said it, despite the warnings of my close advisers who told me not to do this \xe2\x80\x93 it is not good on the eve of elections, why do this?  And I said, I want them to know exactly..'

S'Two days ago, at the rally at Rabin Square, David Grossman, who lost his son Uri in the second Lebanon War, stood and spoke in a speech directed at you, during which he said: \xe2\x80\x9cWhen is the last time the Prime Minister expressed or made a move which is in his power to open a new horizon for Israelis, a better future?  When has he initiated a social or cultural or meritorious step rather than simply respond \xe2\x80\x93 respond recklessly to moves forced on him by others?\xe2\x80\x9d  Is there truth in this?'

sa(dp84

S'That is right.  But it was established just two weeks ago.  Now there are three central areas which I am going to focus on, and I also announced them.  One is the matter of changing the system of government, to create a continuity of stability for our political life, so that we can create genuine stability for our democracy. The second sphere \xe2\x80\x93 is the social sphere.  In this year\xe2\x80\x99s budget which we are about vote on, we have added NIS 3 billion 809 million for social issues.  Another thing is the diplomatic sphere.  There is no stone I will leave unturned, there is no effort I will not make to try to achieve dialogue with the Palestinians.  It is no secret, and you undoubtedly already know this if you read the newspapers.  I approached them in all possible ways, including direct contact between my assistants with Abu-Mazen\xe2\x80\x99s assistants.  He is not ready for a meeting, he does not want a meeting, he still cannot hold a meeting.'

S'There is no question of preconditions.  Everyone understands \xe2\x80\x93 and you must consider it.  When I must meet with Asad, it means that by doing so, I agreed, whether I say it or not \xe2\x80\x93 to withdraw from the entire Golan Heights.  Let us assume for a moment that I would say that I take it upon myself \xe2\x80\x93 in this scenario \xe2\x80\x93 to make this commitment.  Of course the first question that would be asked is: what are we receiving in return?  Is it possible that this will allow us to succeed in cutting Syria off from the axis of evil of Iran and the Hizbullah?  I sit with all the experts in Israel, I consult with them and discuss it with them, and not a single one of them \xe2\x80\x93 not one \xe2\x80\x93 who said that even if we return the entire Golan Heights is there a chance that we will achieve it.  But what will happen if we proceed with this step, if we ignore the fact that Asad is one of the greatest supporters of terror \xe2\x80\x93 he is the man who supports Halad Mashal\xe2\x80\xa6 Throughout the war we are conducting in the territories, in Gaza and Judea and Samaria against Hamas terror \xe2\x80\x93 is Mashal, and this is the man who supports him. Assuming we ignore all this, if we enter into such talks when we know \xe2\x80\x93 in this instance \xe2\x80\x93 that we are prepared to relinquish the entire Golan Heights, and we end up without an agreement, one thing is certain \xe2\x80\x93 there will be war.  And then David Grossman will make another speech and say, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a fool the Prime Minister was.\xe2\x80\x9d  However, it is only in speeches that it is easy to take responsibility for decisions I need to make.'

They investigate one, they investigate two, they investigate three, they investigate\xe2\x80\xa6 For example, I remember that on page 22 there was an obituary for Grandmother Feige from Ramat Hasharon, and it was also written that the Attorney General found that there was nothing regarding the pens \xe2\x80\x93 one does not remember that, they only remember the smoke.  They refute one thing and then another and then another, and in the end, a normal person like you, says: what?  All this, all this smoke without a little fire?  And I say to you, there is no fire, there is nothing.  There is something insufferable in this, unacceptable and unprecedented \xe2\x80\x93 in my opinion, despite the fact that all recent prime ministers have had similar experiences of being investigated, they were not organized campaigns like that being conducted against me.'
p100
sg4

We said that there are situations in which you do something, and you do it in complete innocence, and after 5 years someone pulls it out of its context, puts it on you and ascribes you malicious intentions, does so week after week, and whoever reads these things can think that for all these months, I have done nothing but buy and sell apartments. In the 37 years of my marriage, I bought or sold 3 or 4 apartments, which happens with every average citizen, I suppose.  However, this is not the point.  In the end, there were several things we chatted about amongst ourselves \xe2\x80\x93 who can say something about this or that matter, for example, what will be \xe2\x80\x93 and two days later, you are accused of having done, received, your were sold something, you bought something \xe2\x80\x93 there is something malicious and organized, which is being conducted on an unprecedented scale.  And I have to ask myself if I am running the State of Israel or if I am being dragged into dealing with other things.  No one agreed to distract me from matters which are important to me.'

S': There are people in the media, there are people in politics, there are people in the government, and when they all get together \xe2\x80\x93 it is broad.  There is undoubtedly something here.  Look, one or two weeks ago, I do not remember exactly when \xe2\x80\x93 I was sitting in a meeting at my bureau, in which the most fateful subjects for the State of Israel were discussed.  I cannot tell you how many, but I can tell you how \xe2\x80\x93 the most fateful subjects related to the State of Israel, and you sit there and you need a clear head and need to be completely focused and know that now there is nothing which can distract you \xe2\x80\x93 because this is it.  And then we heard a knock on the door, and the door opened and one of my assistants said, \xe2\x80\x9cSorry to interrupt.\xe2\x80\x9d  I said that he could not interrupt now, now I am busy.  He said, yes, but they are accusing you in regard to the bank and in regard to this and that, and we must respond, the news will be on soon and we must respond.  I said, I heard, close the door, I will not respond now. Later, they, your colleagues at the newspaper, accuse me of not responding, why did you not say?  I am busy with the most important matters of the State of Israel, and I will continue to do so.

S'In truth, when I served as Mayor, there was a Gay Pride Parade in Jerusalem.  However, it was a much more balanced parade, moderate, quiet \xe2\x80\x93 there was no element of provocation.  There is no doubt that the way in which it is presented by the organizers \xe2\x80\x93 there was some attempt to provoke.  I think even the organizers say so.  On the other hand, in a democracy there is the right to provoke.  The Haredim also have the right to protest this matter exactly as they are protesting \xe2\x80\x93 I speak of their right to legitimately protest.  I do not determine.  If the police says that they can protect the parade, then it should be held, and if the police says that it cannot protect the parade \xe2\x80\x93 we need their professional opinion.'

p131
sa(dp132

S'And in a sense, there is nothing more topical, Prime Minister, than the results of the mid-term elections in the United States, particularly since you are on your way to Washington practically to see George Bush.  I do not know if that will be a particularly happy meeting for George Bush, certainly given what has happened here.  What do you think is the significance of this dramatic change in American public opinion?'

S'If you do not mind, before I start with American politics, which naturally is very important \xe2\x80\x93 it is almost even more important than our internal politics because it helps sometimes \xe2\x80\x93 I want first to take this opportunity to express my deep regret over the events which took place yesterday morning in Beit Hanoun, with the unfortunate shooting of Israeli artillery on innocent Palestinians in Beit Hanoun, which resulted in the killing of 18 civilians, most of them are members of one family.  This is certainly not the policy of Israel, this is not the objective of the Government of Israel, and this is tragic and we are very sad about it, and we deeply regret it.'
p134
sa(dp135
g2
S'Of course, unfortunately, this is part of the context.  It could have happened the other way around with all the rockets, the Qassam rockets which are fired at the Israelis in Sderot, in Ashkelon and in other places.  These are shot, aiming at individual citizens on purpose, while what we do is try to spot armed people who are perpetrating this terror against us.  But still, I feel that Israel is strong enough and powerful enough to be able to say that we regret it very much, that this is another good reason why the terror should stop completely and entirely from Gaza, and that we should try to move into a political agenda which will allow us to talk with the Palestinians and this is the message that I am going to bring with me to the United States.'
p136

S"I was going to move on to that.  But to get down to a very important matter, can I put it to you that whatever the intentions of the two sides may be, that this question of proportionality keeps on being raised in this issue that in practice Palestinian civilians or earlier in the year, Lebanese civilians appeared to be hit disproportionately in the view of many people, and that is something which is damaging Israel's standing in the world."
p137
sa(dp138

S"You know, the Israeli reaction is not proportional.  And I suggested to him, and maybe you could help me.  I said, 'Mr. Secretary General, would you be so kind as to give me what is a proportional reaction for the shooting of 1,000 Qassam rockets on innocent civilians in many of the southern townships of the State of Israel?  How can you measure the proportion?  By the number of rockets?  By the number of sleepless nights for babies and children in all of those areas, who may have not been hit directly, but who are going through the pain and the fear and the horror and the hysteria for more than two years.'"

S'Many people measure it in terms of the number of people killed, the number of military personnel killed versus the number of civilians killed, and that is why Israel is so often criticized internationally.'
p140
sa(dp141

S'Yes, hypocrisy is a common practice in some countries, and we are familiar with it.  That is why it is true that sometimes people can measure it by the number of the people that are killed.  Most of the people killed in Gaza are armed people, members of the terrorist organizations who are perpetrating these terrorist actions.  And they do not deserve any other punishment.'

The direction was an orange grove from where we spotted the firing of Qassam rockets seconds before.  And instead of going this direction, it went that direction.  I can only promise you that we will never shoot directly where there are innocent civilians living.  But I cannot promise you that where we will shoot here, it will not by some technical failure will go there.  I hope it will not.  Believe me, we do not gain anything from it; we do not want to gain anything from it.  It does not help.  It just does not help.'

Well, occasionally we have to react, but we are disengaged because we pulled out all of the Israeli civilians and we dismantled 17 townships which were a great pride for us in many different ways.

p166

S'But one cannot ignore the fact that in spite of this, in spite of the fact that they cannot claim that we occupy one centimeter of Gaza, they did not stop shooting Qassam rockets at us from day one.  What else do you need to do?  What else do you need to do in order to convince them that it is time for them to reconcile, to change their priorities, to get to the table and sit down and talk seriously, rather than shoot and shoot and shoot and call for more terror, and cause so many victims on the Palestinian side, and destroy every fabric of life at a time when they could flourish.  I mean, they can look at us \xe2\x80\x93 it is not from a big distance \xe2\x80\x93 and they can see how the economy of Israel is flourishing.

He is unfortunately preoccupied with the divisions in the Palestinian community, with the pressure of these hard-liners from Hamas, with the terrorist groups, and apparently he does not possess the power to overrule them and to come forward. Now I think that Ms. Beckett knows it.  The British Government knows it.  The President of the United States understands it, and many others.  I do not think that there is going to be a wide criticism against us, because you can count on the terrorist organizations to put things very soon in the right perspective with the continued shooting of Qassam rockets.  Even today is just another example of the total lack of flexibility and understanding that is screwing everything for such a long time.  But, I want to add to this, I have a lot of respect for Abu Mazen, and I can say, and I do not want anyone to misunderstand, when we will sit down to the negotiating table, he is going to be a very tough negotiator.  He is not a patriot of Israel, he is a Palestinian patriot.  And, I trust him that he will fight for the Palestinians' interests very vigorously as he does.  But at least he is decent, he is upfront, he is against terror, and therefore I am ready to sit with him any time \xe2\x80\x93 today, tomorrow \xe2\x80\x93 without any preconditions."

The most sensitive, the most important thing for the Palestinians is the release of prisoners.  I do not know if you are aware of it, but long before the abduction of Gilad Shalit, I met with President Mubarak, with King Abdallah II, with Tony Blair, with President Bush, with President Chirac, and I said to them when they asked me, 'What are you up for?'  I said, when I am going to meet with Abu Mazen, I will release hundreds of prisoners \xe2\x80\x93 unconditionally.  Why?  Because I want everyone amongst the Palestinians to see that when there is a leader who is prepared to sit with us, he deserves to be recognized rather than the extremists.  And I say today to the Palestinians, you do not know how many prisoners you could get, how many of your kids could be at home had they released Gilad Shalit.  The enemies of the prisoners are the Hamas people, the extremists."

President Bush is president for another 2 years, and I want to remind you of something you will remember because you are a veteran observer of international politics.  You know that the two best years, the two best years of Bill Clinton in government were after the mid-term elections in 1994, when the poor guy lost the House and I think the Senate as well, and Newt Gringrich became Speaker of the House.  And everyone said, 'Bill Clinton is dead.  He will never be re-elected.'

I do not remember, but after the mid-term elections\xe2\x80\xa6 I think 1996, he was first elected in 1992, it was 1994 and in 1996, he was re-elected \xe2\x80\x93 was because he battled against a majority of Republicans in Congress, which worked in his favor."

And he thought at that time that it will not happen in his lifetime and it happened this year.

First of all, I'll answer the hypocrisy of some. Lieberman was hardly a member of cabinet in all the history of Israel. What were those who are preaching to Lieberman doing about the condition of the Arabs in Israel?  Zero.  So I don't need the criticism of those that never did anything, only knew how to criticize.  By the way, while Lieberman was in the Cabinet, strangely enough, he voted for the Roadmap and he voted for a two-state solution with the Palestinians.  So he's not that bad.  You know, it's very good to have a Lieberman in the Cabinet and to encourage him to take the right positions when it comes to a vote in the Cabinet.  So I don't think that there is a problem here."

There are two segments of the Israeli population which suffer from poverty more than all the others.   One is the ultra Orthodox community and one is the Arab community.  These are two entirely different communities, but they are on the lowest echelon of our society and we will have to take serious measures in order to change it.  Already in this budget we have allocated 3 billion, 800 and 9 million shekels, in addition to the natural growth, in comparison into the budget of last year, to cope with social needs and a large part of these budgets are going to be allocated to the periphery in the south and in the north to also meet the needs of the ultra Orthodox and the Arab community in Israel."

Was this the case on the twelfth of July?  Not at all.  There was zero deterrence.  They tried to abduct Israeli soldiers in January.  They continued in March.  They continued in June and they finally succeeded in July.'

Now ask them if they will try again.  I will only remind you of what Nasrallah said, 'Had I known only 1% of what would happen, I would have never started.'  Now he knows.  Therefore my judgment is that as a result of this war, of this 'disproportionate reaction' of Israel, they will not start another such war against the State of Israel.

Now we are a lot more conscious about this danger than we were before the twelfth of July because of the war in Lebanon.

S'I think putting on preconditions is a way to make sure that the peace process does not move forward. For 15 years, Israelis and Palestinians have been negotiating. There has been robust construction of communities and settlements throughout. Nobody placed this precondition. And I think placing it right now is to make sure that the peace process does not go forward. The issue of the settlements has to be resolved. It should be resolved at the end of negotiations, not before the negotiations. And the sooner we put it aside and start moving and talking about how do we actually live next to one another, how do we have the Palestinians live next to Israel without threatening Israel, without having the territories that are ceded to them become bases for thousands of rockets that have already been launched at Israel from other places that we vacated? If we can get this idea of mutual recognition and security, then well have a solution to all the problems, including the problem of settlements.'

S'I said that I would look to reconcile two things. One is to start the peace process again, something that Im glad - I hope that we started today. And, second, to enable normal life to continue. There are a quarter of a million people living in these communities. You know, they need kindergartens. They need schools. They need health clinics. Theyre living. Im committed not to build new settlements. I am committed not to expropriate additional land for existing settlements. But people have to live. You cant freeze life.So there is a way, I think, to re-launch a peace process and not get bogged down with this question, because weve just wasted six months on this issue. We could waste another six months. I think thats not good. I want to move on to peace... And I think the sooner we put this to the side, the quicker we can move forward towards peace.'

S'No, we actually didnt get into these discussions. But Im sure if theres a will to re-launch the peace process, youll find me committed to that. Anytime Israel met an Arab leader who has genuinely committed to peace, such as Anwar Sadat, we made peace. That was a Likud government under Menachem Begin. When Yitzhak Rabin, the Labor prime minister, met the late King Hussein, who wanted peace, we made peace. If the Palestinian leadership says we want peace, we recognize Israel as the Jewish state, the nation state of the Jewish people, just as were asked to recognize the Palestinian state as the nation state of the Palestinian people. If you recognize Israels right to exist as the Jewish state and if we have the necessary security arrangements of demilitarization, I think well move to peace. And thats the winning formula for peace - a demilitarized Palestinian state that recognizes the Jewish state. Thats something that I have united the country behind and we can move forward and get on with it. And get on with peace.'

S' Well, you know, weve had peace negotiations when settlements were being built without any limitations. I have made certain suggestions on how to move forward and I think the Palestinians have to understand, heres a government in Israel that unites the political spectrum. It wants peace. It wants to move ahead with peace. It wants a genuine peace, a defensible peace, one in which the Palestinians recognize Israel and Israel has the necessary security. But we want the Palestinians to live next to us in dignity and also in prosperity and security.This is an opportunity. Dont waste it. Dont squander this opportunity by discussing issues - issues that will only block the progress of the negotiations. Lets go. Lets move.'

S' No, Charlie, I said no preconditions on the beginning of negotiations. I said Im willing to go anywhere, anyplace to meet any Arab leader and, first of all, the Palestinian leaders, to move towards peace. I certainly think we have certain foundations for those negotiations to succeed. I think the Palestinians have to recognize Israel as the Jewish state and I think we need security. But I didnt place any conditions on beginning the negotiations. And its precisely those preconditions on negotiations that have stymied our progress so far.So Im glad President Obama called this meeting today. I hope it puts aside the question of preconditions. Everybody said theyre not placing preconditions. Im not and I hope the Palestinians dont. I think we have to move on with the business of peace.'

I mean since being installed as Prime Minister which was about six months ago, I said \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s meet and let\xe2\x80\x99s talk peace.  Let\xe2\x80\x99s not talk about talking peace.  Let\xe2\x80\x99s just get together and do it.  And I\xe2\x80\x99m glad that President Obama hosted this meeting.

S'Look, how do we get a real peace between Israel and the Palestinians?  Why don\xe2\x80\x99t we resolve our problems so we can give our children a better future?  Now, mind you, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t waited.  We\xe2\x80\x99ve been six months in office.  We\xe2\x80\x99ve removed hundreds of roadblocks, checkpoints, opened the Allenby Bridge so goods and services and people can come back and forth into the West Bank.  The results are spectacular.  The West Bank economy, according to the IMF, is growing at 7%.  If we meet and talk \xe2\x80\x93 we can make it grow double digits.  And that is good for peace.  It\xe2\x80\x99s not a substitute but it helps.'

S'But where do we stand? The President, you\xe2\x80\x99re saying the right things.  President Obama is saying the right things.  He says it\xe2\x80\x99s the time to act.  There\xe2\x80\x99s a window of opportunity.  He\xe2\x80\x99s going to send Hillary Clinton and George Mitchell back to the Middle East and try and build on this progress, but the fact of the matter is, George Mitchell just returned from the Middle East and accomplished almost nothing.  He didn\xe2\x80\x99t get the Palestinians to agree to negotiate without pre-conditions, he didn\xe2\x80\x99t get you to agree to dropping your insistence there could be no freeze of settlements.  So where do we stand?  What progress can we build on?'

S'This is an amazing claim.  We\xe2\x80\x99ve been talking to the Palestinians from 1993 which is what, sixteen years \xe2\x80\x93 successive Israeli governments to successive Palestinian administrations.  There\xe2\x80\x99s never been this pre-condition of freezing settlements ever put up.  It\xe2\x80\x99s just been put up now artificially.  Now, look, I\xe2\x80\x99m willing to make gestures to help the peace process.'

S'You say that you\xe2\x80\x99re willing to talk to the Palestinians without pre-conditions, but by refusing to freeze settlements on the West Bank, they say that that\xe2\x80\x99s a hollow promise \xe2\x80\x93 that you know you have basically stopped peace talks before they can begin.   How do you respond to that?'

S'Well, we\xe2\x80\x99ll get there very soon, I suppose.  But I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you one thing I\xe2\x80\x99m not willing to do.  I can\xe2\x80\x99t freeze life.  There are a quarter of a million people there, in these communities which are called \xe2\x80\x98settlements\xe2\x80\x99, although really most of them are bedroom suburbs of Tel Aviv and Jerusalem.  They need schools, they need kindergartens, they need health clinics.  Mind you, the fate of the settlements will be determined in the negotiations, at the end of the negotiations, but you can\xe2\x80\x99t determine it before the negotiations.  So I think the sooner we get off this obstacle, and get down to the business of forging a real peace with the Palestinians recognizing the Jewish state of Israel, and allowing for them a demilitarized state \xe2\x80\x93 that is a state in which they can govern themselves with all the powers they need, absent those that could threaten the State of Israel.  I think that\xe2\x80\x99s the winning formula for peace \xe2\x80\x93 demilitarized state that recognizes the Jewish state.'

S'If President Obama supports this process, if he would support an outcome, a resolution that Mr. Abbas and myself would arrive at \xe2\x80\x93 I think it would give an important boost to a peace that we want, and I think we can achieve if we have on the other side a Sadat.  You know, we got Sadat \xe2\x80\x93 we made peace.  We got the late King Hussein \xe2\x80\x93 we made peace.  I\xe2\x80\x99ll never forget how he came to the Wye River Conference from his deathbed and he moved me to tears.  We can make peace.  Now Mr. Abbas has to decide \xe2\x80\x93 Abu Mazen, the head of the Palestinian Authority \xe2\x80\x93 Are you an Arafat, or are you a Sadat?  If you\xe2\x80\x99re a Sadat, I will make peace with you.'

And the Iranian regime is vulnerable \xe2\x80\x93 it\xe2\x80\x99s economically vulnerable, it\xe2\x80\x99s politically extremely vulnerable for a simple reason \xe2\x80\x93 the Iranian people hate it \xe2\x80\x93 they detest this medieval, backward regime that is gunning them down, it\xe2\x80\x99s like choking in their blood on the sidewalks protesting for freedom.  This is the time to apply pressure against this criminal regime, and even if the UN Security Council can\xe2\x80\x99t get its act together, the leading powers of the day can put enormous pressure on Iran, especially when it comes to imported petroleum products which we call in simple language \xe2\x80\x98gasoline\xe2\x80\x99.'

S'Real quickly, I want to end and I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry to cut short the time.  But on Iran \xe2\x80\x93 you said that Iran is weaker than people think.  You are convinced that they are attempting to build nuclear weapons, and you\xe2\x80\x99ve said tougher sanctions are a way to prevent that.  China and Russia have never been on board with those tougher sanctions.  The President tried yesterday to talk to the Chinese about that \xe2\x80\x93 it\xe2\x80\x99s unclear if he made any progress.  Absent China and Russia joining that move for tougher sanctions \xe2\x80\x93 if they continue to move down the road they\xe2\x80\x99re on and develop nuclear weapons, in your opinion, at what point do you go it alone?  At what point do you strike?'
